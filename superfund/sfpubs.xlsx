Several neurotoxic PCB congeners are chiral and undergo enantiomeric enrichment in mammalian species, which may modulate PCB developmental neurotoxicity. This study measures levels and enantiomeric enrichment of PCB 95 and its hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PCBs) in adult female C57Bl/6 mice following subchronic exposure to racemic PCB 95. Tissue levels of PCB 95 and OH-PCBs increased with increasing dose. Dose-dependent enantiomeric enrichment of PCB 95 was observed in brain and other tissues. OH-PCBs also displayed enantiomeric enrichment in blood and liver, but were not detected in adipose and brain. In light of data suggesting enantioselective effects of chiral PCBs on molecular targets linked to PCB developmental neurotoxicity, our observations highlight the importance of accounting for PCB and OH-PCB enantiomeric enrichment in the assessment of PCB developmental neurotoxicity.|5|2012|Environ Sci Technol (Environmental science & technology)||Kania-Korwel, Barnhart, Stamou, Truong, El-Komy, Mohammed H M E, Lein, Veng-Pedersen, Lehmler.

2,3-cis-2R,3R-(-)-epiafzelechin-3-O-p-coumarate, a novel flavan-3-ol isolated from Fallopia convolvulus seed, is an estrogen receptor agonist in human cell lines|Brennan, Jennifer C.; Denison, Michael S.; Holstege, Dirk M.; Magiatis, Prokopios; Dallas, Jerry L.; Gutierrez, Elisa G.; Soshilov, Anatoly A.; Millam, James R.||BACKGROUND: The plant genus Fallopia is well-known in Chinese traditional medicine and includes many species that contain bioactive compounds, namely phytoestrogens. Consumption of phytoestrogens may be linked to decreased incidence of breast and prostate cancers therefore discovery of novel phytoestrogens and novel sources of phytoestrogens is of interest. Although phytoestrogen content has been analyzed in the rhizomes of various Fallopia sp., seeds of a Fallopia sp. have never been examined for phytoestrogen presence. METHODS: Analytical chemistry techniques were used with guidance from an in vitro estrogen receptor bioassay (a stably transfected human ovarian carcinoma cell line) to isolate and identify estrogenic components from seeds of Fallopia convolvulus. A transiently transfected human breast carcinoma cell line was used to characterize the biological activity of the isolated compounds on estrogen receptors (ER) alpha and beta. RESULTS: Two compounds, emodin and the novel flavan-3-ol, (-)-epiafzelechin-3-O-p-coumarate (rhodoeosein), were identified to be responsible for estrogenic activity of F. convolvulus seed extract. Absolute stereochemistry of rhodoeosein was determined by 1 and 2D NMR, optical rotation and circular dichroism. Emodin was identified by HPLC/DAD, LC/MS/MS, and FT/ICR-MS. When characterizing the ER specificity in biological activity of rhodoeosein and emodin, rhodoeosein was able to exhibit a four-fold greater relative estrogenic potency (REP) in breast cells transiently-transfected with ERbeta as compared to those transfected with ERalpha, and emodin exhibited a six-fold greater REP in ERbeta-transfected breast cells. Cell type-specific differences were observed with rhodoeosein but not emodin; rhodoeosein produced superinduction of reporter gene activity in the human ovarian cell line (> 400% of maximum estradiol [E2] induction) but not in the breast cell line. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to characterize the novel flavan-3-ol compound, rhodoeosein, and its ability to induce estrogenic activity in human cell lines. Rhodoeosein and emodin may have potential therapeutic applications as natural products activating ERbeta, and further characterization of rhodoeosein is necessary to evaluate its selectivity as a cell type-specific ER agonist.|5|2013|BMC Complement Altern Med (BMC complementary and alternative medicine)||Brennan, Denison, Holstege, Magiatis, Dallas, Gutierrez, Soshilov, Millam.

Antibodies were prepared using different strategies of hapten conjugation, and the best hapten/antibody pair was selected. It proved to be a reliable tool to measure the herbicide in the 2.0-20 ng/mL range in field samples, with excellent correlation with high-performance liquid chromatography results. The assay was used to study the dissipation of the herbicide in the floodwater of experimental rice paddies in Uruguay. Large differences in the residual amounts of herbicide were observed depending on the flooding practices. Because of its robustness and simplicity, the assay may be useful to delineate and monitor management practices that can contribute to minimizing the release of the herbicide in the environment.|3|2010|J.

A Comparison of Hydroxyl Radical and Hydrogen Peroxide Generation in Ambient Particle Extracts and Laboratory Metal Solutions|Shen, Huiyun; Anastasio, Cort||Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) - including superoxide ((•)O(2) (-)), hydrogen peroxide (HOOH), and hydroxyl radical ((•)OH) - has been suggested as one mechanism underlying the adverse health effects caused by ambient particulate matter (PM). In this study we compare HOOH and (•)OH production from fine and coarse PM collected at an urban (Fresno) and rural (Westside) site in the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) of California, as well as from laboratory solutions containing dissolved copper or iron. Samples were extracted in a cell-free, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution containing 50 μM ascorbate (Asc). In our laboratory solutions we find that Cu is a potent source of both HOOH and (•)OH, with approximately 90% of the electrons that can be donated from Asc ending up in HOOH and (•)OH after 4 h. In contrast, in Fe solutions there is no measurable HOOH and only a modest production of (•)OH. Soluble Cu in the SJV PM samples is also a dominant source of HOOH and (•)OH. In both laboratory copper solutions and extracts of ambient particles we find much more production of HOOH compared to (•)OH: e.g., HOOH generation is approximately 30 - 60 times faster than (•)OH generation. The formation of HOOH and (•)OH are positively correlated, with roughly 3 % and 8 % of HOOH converted to (•)OH after 4 and 24 hr of extraction, respectively. Although the SJV PM produce much more HOOH than (•)OH, since (•)OH is a much stronger oxidant it is unclear which species might be more important for oxidant-mediated toxicity from PM inhalation.|7|2012|Atmos Environ (1994) (Atmospheric environment (Oxford, England : 1994))||Shen, Anastasio.

A general-purpose baseline estimation algorithm for spectroscopic data|Barkauskas, Donald A.; Rocke, David M.|Algorithms; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/methods; Proteomics/methods; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization/methods|"A common feature of many modern technologies used in proteomics--including nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and mass spectrometry--is the generation of large amounts of data for each subject in an experiment. Extracting the signal from the background noise, however, poses significant challenges. One important part of signal extraction is the correct identification of the baseline level of the data. In this article, we propose a new algorithm (the ""BXR algorithm"") for baseline estimation that can be directly applied to different types of spectroscopic data, but also can be specifically tailored to different technologies. We then show how to adapt the algorithm to a particular technology--matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry--which is rapidly gaining popularity as an analytic tool in proteomics. Finally, we compare the performance of our algorithm to that of existing algorithms for baseline estimation. The BXR algorithm is computationally efficient, robust to the type of one-sided signal that occurs in many modern applications (including NMR and mass spectrometry), and improves on existing baseline estimation algorithms. It is implemented as the function baseline in the R package FTICRMS, available either from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (http://www.r-project.org/) or from the first author."|Core A|2010|Anal.

The method is significantly more straightforward than other extant methods. Measurements of the luminescent emissions from the Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles, in comparison with control silica nanoparticles without silver cores, showed that the presence of the silver cores can increase the fluorescence intensity approximately 24-fold and decrease the luminescence lifetime. This enhancement offers a potential increase in overall particle detectability with increased fluorophore photostability.|2|2009|Nanotechnology (Nanotechnology)||Ma, Dosev, Kennedy. (2009).

A novel fractionation approach for water constituents - distribution of storm event metals|McKenzie, Erica R.; Young, Thomas M.||A novel fractionation method, based on both particle size and settling characteristics, was employed to examine metal distributions among five fractions. In-stream and stormwater runoff samples were collected from four land use types: highway, urban, agricultural (storm event and irrigation), and natural. Highway samples contained the highest dissolved concentrations for most metals, and freshwater ambient water quality criteria were exceeded for Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn in the first storm of the water year. Anthropogenic sources were indicated for Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb in highway and urban samples, and total metal loadings (mg km(-2)) were observed to be as follows: highway > urban > agricultural storm event approximately natural > agricultural irrigation. Notably, approximately 10-fold higher suspended solids concentration was observed in the agricultural storm event sample, and suspended solids-associated metals were correspondingly elevated. Distribution coefficients revealed the following affinities: Zn, Ni, Cd, and Pb to large dense particles; and Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni, and Pb to colloidal organic matter.|1|2013|Environ Sci Process Impacts (Environmental science)||McKenzie, Young.

A novel p21 attenuator which is structurally related to sorafenib|Wettersten, Hiromi I.; Hee Hwang, Sung; Li, Cuiwen; Shiu, Eunice Y.; Wecksler, Aaron T.; Hammock, Bruce D.; Weiss, Robert H.||p21 is a member of the cyclin kinase inhibitor family of proteins and plays pivotal roles in cellular proliferation as well as in the regulation of apoptosis, and thus has diverse functions in diseases as varied as cancer and atherosclerosis. In light of its pleiotropic effects and potential clinical relevance, new methods of attenuation of p21 protein levels by selective inhibitors are therefore powerful tools to probe malignant, infectious and other diseases. Here we introduce a novel p21 attenuator, UC2288, which possesses consistent and relatively selective activity for p21. UC2288 was synthesized based on the chemical model of sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor that also attenuates p21, but unlike sorafenib, UC2288 did not inhibit Raf kinases or alter p-ERK protein levels. UC2288 decreased p21 mRNA expression independently of p53, and attenuated p21 protein levels with minimal effect on p21 protein stability. In addition, UC2288 inhibits cell growth in the kidney cancer cell lines (GI50 = approximately 10 µM) as well as multiple other cancer cell lines. Thus, this novel p21 inhibitor will be indispensable for exploring the function of p21, and upon further study may be translatable to the clinic.|Core A|2013|Cancer Biol. Ther.

To identify proteins whose expression is modified by these environmental stressors, we performed a proteomic analysis on larval green and white sturgeons exposed to 18 or 26 degrees C and micro-injected with Seleno-L-Methionine to reach 8microgg(-)(1) selenium body burden, with L-Methionine as a control. Selenium and high temperature induced mortalities and abnormal morphologies in both species, with a higher mortality in green sturgeon. Larval proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and differential abundances were detected following spot quantitation and hierarchical cluster analysis. In green sturgeon, 34 of 551 protein spots detected on gels showed a variation in abundance whereas in white sturgeon only 9 of 580 protein spots were differentially expressed (P<0.01). Gel replicates were first grouped according to heat treatment. Fifteen of these spots were identified using MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. Proteins involved in protein folding, protein synthesis, protein degradation, ATP supply and structural proteins changed in abundance in response to heat and/or selenium. 40S ribosomal protein SA, FK506-binding protein 10, 65kDa regulatory subunit A of protein phosphatase 2, protein disulfide isomerase, stress-induced-phosphoprotein 1, suppression of tumorigenicity 13 and collagen type II alpha 1, were differentially expressed in high temperature treatment only. Serine/arginine repetitive matrix protein 1, creatine kinase, serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal type 5 and HSP90 were sensitive to combined temperature and selenium exposure. Valosin-containing protein, a protein involved in aggresome formation and in protein quality control decreased more than 50% in response to selenium treatment. Potential use of such proteins as biomarkers of environmental stressors in larval sturgeons could indicate early warning signals preceding population decline.|Core B|2010|Sci. Total Environ.

Accelerated immunoassays based on magnetic particle dynamics in a rotating capillary tube with stationary magnetic field|Lee, Jun-Tae; Sudheendra, L.; Kennedy, Ian M.|Antigen-Antibody Reactions; Immunoassay/instrumentation; Magnetic Fields; Magnetite Nanoparticles/chemistry; Particle Size; Polystyrenes/chemistry|A rapid and simple magnetic particle-based immunoassay has been demonstrated in a capillary mixing system. Antibody-coated micrometer size superparamagnetic polystyrene (SPP) particles were used in an assay for rabbit IgG in a sandwich (noncompetitive) format. The kinetics of the assay was compared between a plate-based system and a single capillary tube. The interaction between the antigen (R-IgG) and the antibody (anti-R-IgG) that was carried by the SPP particles in a rotating capillary was tested under a stationary magnetic field. Competing magnetic and viscous drag forces helped to enhance the interaction between the analyte and the capture antibodies on the particles. The dimensionless Mason number (Mn) was employed to characterize the magnetic particle dynamics; a previously determined critical Mason number (Mn(c)) was employed as a guide to the appropriate experimental conditions of magnetic field strength and rotational speed of the capillary. The advantage of the rotating capillary system included a short assay time and a reduced reactive volume (20 μL).

Acute augmentation of epoxygenated fatty acid levels rapidly reduces pain-related behavior in a rat model of type I diabetes|Inceoglu, Bora; Wagner, Karen; Yang, Jun; Bettaieb, Ahmed; Schebb, Nils H.; Hwang, Sung Hee; Morisseau, Christophe; Haj, Fawaz G.; Hammock, Bruce D.|Amines/pharmacology; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids/pharmacology; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/drug therapy/metabolism; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Design; Fatty Acids/metabolism; Glucose/metabolism; Hyperalgesia/drug therapy; Insulin/metabolism; Lipids/therapeutic use; Male; Models, Chemical; Pain/drug therapy/metabolism; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Spinal Cord/metabolism; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/pharmacology|The nerve damage occurring as a consequence of glucose toxicity in diabetes leads to neuropathic pain, among other problems. This pain dramatically reduces the quality of life in afflicted patients. The progressive damage to the peripheral nervous system is irreversible although strict control of hyperglycemia may prevent further damage. Current treatments include tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and opioids, depending on the severity of the pain state. However, available therapeutics have drawbacks, arguing for the need to better understand the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain and develop novel treatments. Here we demonstrate that stabilization of a class of bioactive lipids, epoxygenated fatty acids (EpFAs), greatly reduces allodynia in rats caused by streptozocin-induced type I diabetes. Inhibitors of the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEHI) elevated and stabilized the levels of plasma and spinal EpFAs, respectively, and generated dose-dependent antiallodynic effects more potently and efficaciously than gabapentin. In acute experiments, positive modulation of EpFAs did not display differences in insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, or insulin secretion, indicating the efficacy of sEHIs are not related to the glycemic status. Quantitative metabolomic analysis of a panel of 26 bioactive lipids demonstrated that sEHI-mediated antiallodynic effects coincided with a selective elevation of the levels of EpFAs in the plasma, and a decrease in degradation products coincided with the dihydroxy fatty acids in the spinal cord. Overall, these results argue that further efforts in understanding the spectrum of effects of EpFAs will yield novel opportunities in treating neuropathic pain.|Core A|2012|Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Age specific responses to acute inhalation of diffusion flame soot particles: cellular injury and the airway antioxidant response|van Winkle, Laura S.; Chan, Jackie K.

We have developed a laboratory-based PM that is replicable, does not contain dust or metals and that can be used to study specific health effects of PM composition in animal models. We exposed both neonatal (7 days of age) and adult rats to a single 6-h exposure of laboratory generated fine diffusion flame particles (DFP; 170 µg/m(3)), or filtered air. Pulmonary gene and protein expression as well as indicators of cytotoxicity were evaluated 24 h after exposure. Although DFP exposure did not alter airway epithelial cell composition in either neonates or adults, increased lactate dehydrogenase activity was found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of neonates indicating an age-specific increase in susceptibility. In adults, 16 genes were differentially expressed as a result of DFP exposure whereas only 6 genes were altered in the airways of neonates. Glutamate cysteine ligase protein was increased in abundance in both DFP exposed neonates and adults indicating an initiation of antioxidant responses involving the synthesis of glutathione. DFP significantly decreased catalase gene expression in adult airways, although catalase protein expression was increased by DFP in both neonates and adults. We conclude that key airway antioxidant enzymes undergo changes in expression in response to a moderate PM exposure that does not cause frank epithelial injury and that neonates have a different response pattern than adults.|4|2010|Inhal Toxicol (Inhalation toxicology)||van Winkle, Chan, Anderson, Kumfer, Kennedy, Wexler, Wallis, Abid, Sutherland, Fanucchi.

Allergic asthma is associated with the production of allergen-specific IgE and expansion of allergen-specific T-cell populations. Progression of allergic inflammation is driven by T-helper type 2 (Th2) mediators and is associated with alterations in the levels of lipid mediators. OBJECTIVES: Responses of the respiratory system to birch allergen provocation in allergic asthmatics were investigated. Eicosanoids and other oxylipins were quantified in the bronchoalveolar lumen to provide a measure of shifts in lipid mediators associated with allergen challenge in allergic asthmatics. METHODS: Eighty-seven lipid mediators representing the cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolic pathways were screened via LC-MS/MS following off-line extraction of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Multivariate statistics using OPLS were employed to interrogate acquired oxylipin data in combination with immunological markers. RESULTS: Thirty-two oxylipins were quantified, with baseline asthmatics possessing a different oxylipin profile relative to healthy individuals that became more distinct following allergen provocation. The most prominent differences included 15-LOX-derived ω-3 and ω-6 oxylipins. Shared-and-Unique-Structures (SUS)-plot modeling showed a correlation (R(2) = 0.7) between OPLS models for baseline asthmatics (R(2)Y[cum] = 0.87, Q(2)[cum] = 0.51) and allergen-provoked asthmatics (R(2)Y[cum] = 0.95, Q(2)[cum] = 0.73), with the majority of quantified lipid mediators and cytokines contributing equally to both groups. Unique structures for allergen provocation included leukotrienes (LTB(4) and 6-trans-LTB(4)), CYP-derivatives of linoleic acid (epoxides/diols), and IL-10. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in asthmatic relative to healthy profiles suggest a role for 15-LOX products of both ω-6 and ω-3 origin in allergic inflammation. Prominent differences at baseline levels indicate that non-symptomatic asthmatics are subject to an underlying inflammatory condition not observed with other traditional mediators. Results suggest that oxylipin profiling may provide a sensitive means of characterizing low-level inflammation and that even individuals with mild disease display distinct phenotypic profiles, which may have clinical ramifications for disease.|Core A|2012|PLoS ONE (PloS one)||Lundström, Yang, Källberg, Thunberg, Gafvelin, Haeggström, Grönneberg, Grunewald, van Hage, Hammock, Eklund, Wheelock, Wheelock.

EETs participate in a wide range of biological functions, including regulation of vascular tone, renal tubular transport, cardiac contractility, and inflammation. Inhibition of sEH is a potential approach for enhancing the biological activity of EETs. Therefore, disruption of sEH activity is becoming an attractive therapeutic target for both cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. To define the physiological role of sEH, we characterized a knockout mouse colony lacking expression of the Ephx2 gene. Lack of sEH enzyme is characterized by elevation of EET to DHET ratios in both the linoleate and arachidonate series in plasma and tissues of both female and male mice. In male mice, this lack of expression was also associated with decreased plasma testosterone levels, sperm count, and testicular size. However, this genotype was still able to sire litters. Plasma cholesterol levels also declined in this genotype. Behavior tests such as anxiety-like behavior and hedonic response were also examined in Ephx2-null and WT mice, as all can be related to hormonal changes. Null mice showed a level of anxiety with a decreased hedonic response.

An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detecting 3-phenoxybenzoic acid in plasma and its application in farmers and consumers|Thiphom, Sarunya; Prapamontol, Tippawan; Chantara, Somporn; Mangklabruks, Ampica; Suphavilai, Chaisuree; Ahn, Ki Chang; Gee, Shirley J.; Hammock, Bruce D.||The aim of this study was to identify a plasma biomarker of exposure to pyrethroid insecticides. A major metabolite, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), can be detected in urine but urinary 3-PBA cannot be used to assess the active dose. The 3-PBA-adduct represents a much more persistent class of biomarkers than metabolites excreted into urine, having half lives up to several weeks or months. We developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for total 3-PBA including adduct formed after alkaline hydrolysis, liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and solid phase extraction (SPE) of the sample. The developed ELISA had an IC50 value of 26.7 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (%CV) were lower than 5% and were within the optimum condition variance (OCV) range. The LLE cleanup technique satisfactorily eliminated the matrix effect from plasma samples before SPE and ELISA analysis yielding good recoveries (85.9-99.4%) with a limit of quantitation (LOQ, 5 ng/mL) that was 30- to 47-fold more sensitive than previous studies. Moreover, the developed method could separate more than 80% of 3-PBA from adduct form. The method was successfully applied to the detection of the target in real samples obtained from consumers (n=50) and farmers (n=50). To our knowledge, this is the first ELISA method for detecting 3-PBA in human plasma and applied to a field study.|3|2012|Anal Methods (Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications)||Thiphom, Prapamontol, Chantara, Mangklabruks, Suphavilai, Ahn, Gee, Hammock.

An ex situ evaluation of TBA- and MTBE-baited bio-traps|North, Katharine P.; Mackay, Douglas M.; Annable, Michael D.; Sublette, Kerry L.; Davis, Greg; Holland, Reef B.; Petersen, Daniel; Scow, Kate M.|Biodegradation, Environmental; DNA, Bacterial/chemistry; Environmental Monitoring/methods; Groundwater/microbiology; Methyl Ethers/chemistry; Polystyrenes/chemistry; Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis; tert-Butyl Alcohol/chemistry|"Aquifer microbial communities can be investigated using Bio-traps(®) (""bio-traps""), passive samplers containing Bio-Sep(®) beads (""bio-beads"") that are deployed in monitoring wells to be colonized by bacteria delivered via groundwater flow through the well. When bio-beads are ""baited"" with organic contaminants enriched in (13)C, stable isotope probing allows assessment of the composition and activity of the microbial community. This study used an ex situ system fed by groundwater continuously extracted from an adjacent monitoring well within an experimentally-created aerobic zone treating a tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) plume. The goal was to evaluate aspects of bio-trap performance that cannot be studied quantitatively in situ. The measured groundwater flow through a bio-trap housing suggests that such traps might typically ""sample"" about 1.8 L per month. The desorption of TBA or methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) bait from bio-traps during a typical deployment duration of 6 weeks was approximately 90% and 45%, respectively, of the total initial bait load, with initially high rate of mass loss that decreased markedly after a few days. The concentration of TBA in groundwater flowing by the TBA-baited bio-beads was estimated to be as high as 3400 mg/L during the first few days, which would be expected to inhibit growth of TBA-degrading microbes. Initial inhibition was also implied for the MTBE-baited bio-trap, but at lower concentrations and for a shorter time. After a few days, concentrations in groundwater flowing through the bio-traps dropped below inhibitory concentrations but remained 4-5 orders of magnitude higher than TBA or MTBE concentrations within the aquifer at the experimental site. Desorption from the bio-beads during ex situ deployment occurred at first as predicted by prior sorption analyses of bio-beads but with apparent hysteresis thereafter, possibly due to mass transfer limitations caused by colonizing microbes. These results suggest that TBA- or MTBE-baited bio-traps could be baited at lower initial total mass loading with no detriment to trapping ability. The bio-traps were able to collect detectable amounts of microbial DNA and thus allow some insight into the sparse microbial community present in the aquifer during remediation of the low concentration plume."|1|2012|Water Res.

An Omega-3 Epoxide of Docosahexaenoic Acid Lowers Blood Pressure in Angiotensin-II-Dependent Hypertension|Ulu, Arzu; Stephen Lee, Kin Sing; Miyabe, Christina; Yang, Jun; Hammock, Bruce G.; Dong, Hua; Hammock, Bruce D.||Mediators of antihypertensive actions of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are largely unknown. The omega-3 epoxide of DHA, 19, 20-EDP (epoxy docosapentaenoic acid), is metabolized by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), which also metabolizes the anti-inflammatory and antihypertensive arachidonic acid epoxides, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). Based in part on plasma levels of EDPs after a DHA-rich diet, we hypothesized that 19, 20-EDP contributes to the antihypertensive actions of DHA in angiotensin-II (Ang-II)-dependent hypertension. Treatment individually with 19, 20-EDP and a potent sEH inhibitor TPPU (1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl) urea) significantly lowered blood pressure (BP) as compared with Ang-II-infused animals. The largest reduction in BP was obtained with the combination of 19, 20-EDP and TPPU, which was more efficacious than the combination of 14, 15-EET and TPPU. Oxylipin profiling revealed that 19, 20-EDP and 14, 15-EET infusion affected not only most metabolites of the P450 pathway but also renal levels of prostaglandin-E2. Our findings suggest that 19, 20-EDP is a mediator of the antihypertensive effects of DHA in Ang-II-dependent hypertension. It seems that 19, 20-EDP requires metabolic stabilization with a sEH inhibitor to be most effective in lowering BP, although both TPPU and 19, 20-EDP are so effective on their own that demonstrating additive or synergistic interactions is difficult.|5|2014|J.

Analgesia mediated by soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors is dependent on cAMP|Inceoglu, Bora; Wagner, Karen; Schebb, Nils H.; Morisseau, Christophe; Jinks, Steven L.; Ulu, Arzu; Hegedus, Christine; Rose, Tristan; Brosnan, Robert; Hammock, Bruce D.|Analgesia; Analgesics/pharmacology; Animals; Cyclic AMP/metabolism; Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4/metabolism; Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology; Epoxide Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors; Epoxy Compounds/metabolism; Male; Pain/drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Second Messenger Systems/drug effects|Pain is a major health concern even though numerous analgesic agents are available. Side effects and lack of wide-spectrum efficacy of current drugs justify efforts to better understand pain mechanisms. Stabilization of natural epoxy-fatty acids (EFAs) through inhibition of the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) reduces pain. However, in the absence of an underlying painful state, inhibition of sEH is ineffective. Surprisingly, a pain-mediating second messenger, cAMP, interacts with natural EFAs and regulates the analgesic activity of sEH inhibitors. Concurrent inhibition of sEH and phosphodiesterase (PDE) dramatically reduced acute pain in rodents. Our findings demonstrate a mechanism of action of cAMP and EFAs in the pathophysiology of pain. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inhibition of various PDE isozymes, including PDE4, lead to significant increases in EFA levels through a mechanism independent of sEH, suggesting that the efficacy of commercial PDE inhibitors could result in part from increasing EFAs. The cross-talk between the two major pathways-one mediated by cAMP and the other by EFAs-paves the way to new approaches to understand and control pain.|5|2011|Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.

In this study, a validated CALUX method was used for the analysis of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs in more than 90 atmospheric deposition samples for different locations in Flanders. The samples were taken in residential and agricultural areas, where a threshold limit of 21pgWHO-TEQm(-2)d(-1) for the sum of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs was set, and in industrial zones and natural reserves, where no official threshold limit is available. The results from the Flemish measurement program showed correlation between CALUX and GC-HRMS for all the samples, originating from the different areas (R(2) of 0.81, 0.53 and 0.64 for dl-PCBs, PCDD/Fs and sum of both fractions, respectively). Median CALUX/GC-HRMS ratios of 2.0, 0.9 and 1.3 were reported for the PCDD/Fs, dioxin-like PCBs and the sum of both fractions, respectively. The results show that the CALUX bioassay is a valuable alternative tool for the classic GC-HRMS analysis of atmospheric deposition samples in the Flemish measurement network.|5|2012|Chemosphere (Chemosphere)||Croes, Vandermarken, van Langenhove, Elskens, Desmedt, Roekens, Denison, van Larebeke, Baeyens.

Anti-inflammatory Effects of Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Inhibitors in Angiotensin-II Dependent Hypertension|Ulu, Arzu; Harris, Todd R.; Morisseau, Christophe; Miyabe, Christina; Inoue, Hiromi; Schuster, Gertrud; Dong, Hua; Iosif, Ana-Maria; Liu, Jun-Yan; Weiss, Robert H.; Chiamvimonvat, Nipavan; Imig, John D.; Hammock, Bruce D.||The mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and anti-hypertensive effects of long chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are still unclear. The epoxides of an ω-6 fatty acid, arachidonic acid (epoxyeicosatrienoic acids; EETs) also exhibit anti-hypertensive and anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, we hypothesized that the major ω-3 PUFAs including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may lower blood pressure and attenuate renal markers of inflammation through their epoxide metabolites. Here, we supplemented mice with an ω-3 rich diet for three weeks in a murine model of angiotensin-II dependent hypertension. Also, since EPA and DHA epoxides are metabolized by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), we tested the combination of a sEH inhibitor and the ω-3 rich diet. Our results show that ω-3 rich diet in combination with the sEH inhibitor lowered Ang-II increased blood pressure, further increased renal levels of EPA and DHA epoxides, reduced renal markers of inflammation (i.e. prostaglandins and MCP-1), down-regulated an epithelial sodium channel and up-regulated Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 message (ACE-2) and significantly modulated cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase metabolic pathways.

Anti-inflammatory properties of prostaglandin E2: deletion of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 exacerbates non-immune inflammatory arthritis in mice|Frolov, Andrey; Yang, Lihua; Dong, Hua; Hammock, Bruce D.; Crofford, Leslie J.||Prostanoids and PGE2 in particular have been long viewed as one of the major mediators of inflammation in arthritis. However, experimental data indicate that PGE2 can serve both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions. We have previously shown (Kojima et al., J. Immunol. 180 (2008) 8361-8368) that microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) deletion, which regulates PGE2 production, resulted in the suppression of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice. This suppression was attributable, at least in part, to the impaired generation of type II collagen autoantibodies. In order to examine the function of mPGES-1 and PGE2 in a non-autoimmune form of arthritis, we used the collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) model in mice deficient in mPGES-1, thereby bypassing the engagement of the adaptive immune response in arthritis development. Here we report that mPGES-1 deletion significantly increased CAIA disease severity. The latter was associated with a significant (~3.6) upregulation of neutrophil, but not macrophage, recruitment to the inflamed joints. The lipidomic analysis of the arthritic mouse paws by quantitative liquid chromatography/tandem mass-spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) revealed a dramatic (~59-fold) reduction of PGE2 at the peak of arthritis. Altogether, this study highlights mPGES-1 and its product PGE2 as important negative regulators of neutrophil-mediated inflammation and suggests that specific mPGES-1 inhibitors may have differential effects on different types of inflammation. Furthermore, neutrophil-mediated diseases could be exacerbated by inhibition of mPGES-1.|Core A|2013|Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent.

Arsenic removal from water using flame-synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles with variable oxidation states|Abid, Aamir D.; Kanematsu, Masakazu; Young, Thomas M.; Kennedy, Ian M.||We utilized gas-phase diffusion flame synthesis, which has potential for large-scale production of metal oxide nanoparticles, to produce iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) with variable oxidation states. The efficacy of these materials in removal of arsenate (As(V) ) from water was assessed. Two different flame configurations, a diffusion flame (DF) and an inverse diffusion flame (IDF), were employed to synthesize six different IONPs by controlling flame conditions. The IONPs produced in the IDF configuration (IDF-IONPs) had smaller particle diameters (4.8 - 8.2 nm) and larger surface areas (141-213 m(2)/g) than the IONPs produced in the DF configuration (29 nm, 36 m(2)/g), which resulted in their higher adsorption capacities. As(V) adsorption capacities of the IDF-IONPs increased when the IONPs were synthesized in more oxidizing conditions. The fully oxidized IDF-IONPs, maghemite (γ-Fe2O3), showed the highest As(V) adsorption capacity, comparable to that of magnetite nanocrystals synthesized by thermal decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl and equivalent to three to four times higher capacity than that of a commonly used goethite-based adsorbent. All IONPs were magnetically responsive, which is of great importance for solid-liquid separation. This study demonstrates that the IONPs synthesized in gas-phase flame, particularly IDF-IONPs, are excellent adsorbents because of their high As(V) sorption capacity, potential for large-scale production, and useful magnetic property.|1|2013|Aerosol Sci Technol (Aerosol science and technology : the journal of the American Association for Aerosol Research)||Abid, Kanematsu, Young, Kennedy.

Arsenite suppression of BMP signaling in human keratinocytes|Phillips, Marjorie A.; Qin, Qin; Hu, Qin; Zhao, Bin; Rice, Robert H.|Arsenites/pharmacology; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 6/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology; Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology; Cells, Cultured; Forkhead Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors; Humans; Keratin-1/physiology; Keratin-10/physiology; Keratinocytes/drug effects/physiology; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Receptors, Notch/physiology; Signal Transduction/drug effects|Arsenic, a human skin carcinogen, suppresses differentiation of cultured keratinocytes. Exploring the mechanism of this suppression revealed that BMP-6 greatly increased levels of mRNA for keratins 1 and 10, two of the earliest differentiation markers expressed, a process prevented by co-treatment with arsenite. BMP also stimulated, and arsenite suppressed, mRNA for FOXN1, an important transcription factor driving early keratinocyte differentiation. Keratin mRNAs increased slowly after BMP-6 addition, suggesting they are indirect transcriptional targets. Inhibition of Notch1 activation blocked BMP induction of keratins 1 and 10, while FOXN1 induction was largely unaffected. Supporting a requirement for Notch1 signaling in keratin induction, BMP increased levels of activated Notch1, which was blocked by arsenite. BMP also greatly decreased active ERK, while co-treatment with arsenite maintained active ERK. Inhibition of ERK signaling mimicked BMP by inducing keratin and FOXN1 mRNAs and by increasing active Notch1, effects blocked by arsenite. Of 6 dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) targeting ERK, two were induced by BMP unless prevented by simultaneous exposure to arsenite and EGF. Knockdown of DUSP2 or DUSP14 using shRNAs greatly reduced FOXN1 and keratins 1 and 10 mRNA levels and their induction by BMP. Knockdown also decreased activated Notch1, keratin 1 and keratin 10 protein levels, both in the presence and absence of BMP. Thus, one of the earliest effects of BMP is induction of DUSPs, which increases FOXN1 transcription factor and activates Notch1, both required for keratin gene expression. Arsenite prevents this cascade by maintaining ERK signaling, at least in part by suppressing DUSP expression.|5|2013|Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol.

In present experiments, arsenite had a dramatic effect in electrophoretic mobility supershift analysis of proteins binding to an involucrin promoter AP1 response element. Without arsenite treatment, binding of JunB and Fra1 was readily detected in nuclear extracts from preconfluent cultures and was not detected a week after confluence, while c-Fos was detected only after confluence. By contrast, band shift of nuclear extracts from arsenite treated cultures showed only JunB and Fra1 binding in postconfluent as well as preconfluent cultures. Immunoblotting of cell extracts showed that arsenite treatment prevented the loss of Fra1 and the increase in c-Fos proteins that occurred after confluence in untreated cultures. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated substantial reduction of c-Fos and acetylated histone H3 at the proximal and distal AP1 response elements in the involucrin promoter and of coactivator p300 at the proximal element. Alteration of AP1 transcription factors was also examined in response to treatment with four metal containing compounds (chromate, vanadate, hemin, divalent cadmium) that also suppress involucrin transcription. These agents all influenced transcription at AP1 elements in a transcriptional reporter assay, but exhibited less effect than arsenite on binding activity assessed by mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation and displayed variable effects on AP1 protein levels. These findings help trace a mechanism by which transcriptional effects of arsenite become manifest and help rationalize the unique action of arsenite, compared to the other agents, to preserve proliferative ability.|5|2010|Toxicol.

Culture of HSCs with SR1 led to a 50-fold increase in cells expressing CD34 and a 17-fold increase in cells that retain the ability to engraft immunodeficient mice.

Estrogenic (E-SCREEN--MCF7-BOS) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) (CAFLUX--H4G1.1c2) activity were assessed for samples collected from each of these locations. The samples were tested either as crude extracts (""untreated"") or were subjected to H2SO4 silica gel (""treated"") for each location in order to determine whether chemicals, which are not resistant to this treatment like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, potentially account for the observed activity. In most cases, H2SO4 treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction of potency for both endpoints, suggesting that chemicals less resistant to treatment may be responsible for much of the detected biological activity in these locations. Estrogenic potency measurements (<0.22-185 pg m(-3)) were highest in the indoor offices, followed by the indoor suburban home and finally the outdoor suburban home (which was not estrogenic). Total AhR activity for crude extracts (1.3-10 pg m(-3)) however was highest for the outdoor suburban home site. Levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were monitored indoors and outdoors at the suburban home. At that location, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon air concentrations were on average approximately two times higher outdoor than indoor, while AhR potency was five times higher outdoor than indoor. No significant correlation was found between the estrogenic and AhR activity (P = 0.88) for the sites in this study."|5|2009|Anal Bioanal Chem (Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry)||Kennedy, Macova, Leusch, Bartkow, Hawker, Zhao, Denison, Mueller.

We have previously demonstrated the beneficial effects of several potent soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitors in cardiac hypertrophy. sEH catalizes the conversion of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) to form the corresponding dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs). EETs are products of cytochrome P450 epoxygenases that have vasodilatory properties. Additionally, EETs inhibit the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-mediated gene transcription. Motivated by the potential to uncover a new class of therapeutic agents for cardiovascular diseases which can be effectively used in clinical setting, we directly tested the biological effects of sEH inhibitors (sEHIs) on the progression of cardiac remodeling using a clinically relevant murine model of MI. We demonstrated that sEHIs were highly effective in the prevention of progressive cardiac remodeling post MI. Using metabolomic profiling of the inflammatory lipid mediators, we documented a significant decrease in EETs/DHETs ratio in MI model predicting a heightened inflammatory state. Treatment with sEHIs resulted in a change in the pattern of lipid mediators from one of inflammation towards resolution. Moreover, the oxylipin profiling showed a striking parallel to the changes in inflammatory cytokines in this model. Our study provides evidence for a possible new therapeutic strategy to improve cardiac function post MI.|Core A|2009|J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol.

We evaluated in mice the developmental neurotoxicity of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), one of the most abundant PBDE congeners detected in animal and human tissues. Female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to daily doses of 0, 0.03, 0.1 or 1mg/kg beginning 4 weeks prior to conception, continuing through gestation and lactation, and ending at weaning on postnatal day (PND) 21. Levels of BDE-47 in blood, brain, liver and adipose tissues of dams were markedly increased after 4 weeks of exposure, around the time of mating, and continued to increase through the time of parturition. Blood levels of BDE-47 in the dosed dams were within the range reported in humans. BDE-47 tissue levels in the dams decreased between parturition and weaning, possibly reflecting mobilization during lactation. Brain BDE-47 levels in the offspring at PND 1 approached those of the dams at parturition. Perinatal exposure to BDE-47 resulted in significant dose dependent growth retardation, slower motor performance in several behavioral tests, and mice exposed to 1mg/kg/day BDE-47 showed altered performance in the Morris water maze. There were no differences between groups in the numbers of pyramidal neurons in hippocampus CA1. These results document accumulation of BDE-47 in several organ systems following exposure to low-levels of BDE-47, and provide evidence that such exposure is associated with early behavioral deficits in exposed neonates.|5|2011|Neurotoxicol Teratol (Neurotoxicology and teratology)||Ta, Koenig, Golub, Pessah, Qi, Aronov, Berman.

Biomarkers of exposure to triclocarban in urine and serum|Ye, Xiaoyun; Zhou, Xiaoliu; Furr, Johnathan; Ahn, Ki Chang; Hammock, Bruce D.; Gray, Earl L.; Calafat, Antonia M.|Animals; Anti-Infective Agents, Local/blood/metabolism/urine; Biological Markers/blood/urine; Carbanilides/blood/metabolism/urine; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Environmental Exposure/adverse effects; Female; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Oxidation-Reduction; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Solid Phase Extraction; Species Specificity; Time Factors; Water Pollutants, Chemical/blood/metabolism/urine|3,4,4'-Trichlorocarbanilide (triclocarban, TCC) is widely used as an antimicrobial agent in a variety of consumer and personal care products. TCC is considered a potential endocrine disruptor, but its potential toxic effects in humans are still largely unknown. Because of its widespread uses, the potential for human exposure to TCC is high. In order to identify adequate exposure biomarkers of TCC, we investigated the metabolic profile of TCC in adult female Sprague Dawley rats after administering TCC once (500 mg/kg body weight) by oral gavage. Urine was collected 0-24 h before dosing, and 0-24 h and 24-48 h after dosing. Serum was collected at necropsy 48 h after dosing. We identified several metabolites of TCC in urine and serum by on-line solid phase extraction-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We unambiguously identified two major oxidative metabolites of TCC, 3'-hydroxy-TCC and 2'-hydroxy-TCC, by comparing their chromatographic behavior and mass spectral fragmentation patterns with those of authentic standards. By contrast, compared to these oxidative metabolites, we detected very low levels of TCC in the urine or serum. Taken together these data suggest that in rats, oxidation of TCC is a major metabolic pathway. We also measured TCC and its oxidative metabolites in 50 urine and 16 serum samples collected from adults in the United States. The results suggest differences in the metabolic profile of TCC in rats and in humans; oxidation appears to be a minor metabolic pathway in humans. Total (free plus conjugated) TCC could serve as a potential biomarker for human exposure to TCC.|3|2011|Toxicology (Toxicology)||Ye, Zhou, Furr, Ahn, Hammock, Gray, Calafat. (2011).

Bovine milk as a source of functional oligosaccharides for improving human health|Zivkovic, Angela M.; Barile, Daniela|Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria/drug effects/growth & development; Cattle; Dietary Supplements; Functional Food; Humans; Intestines/microbiology; Milk/chemistry; Milk, Human/chemistry; Oligosaccharides/chemistry/pharmacology; Prebiotics|Human milk oligosaccharides are complex sugars that function as selective growth substrates for specific beneficial bacteria in the gastrointestinal system. Bovine milk is a potentially excellent source of commercially viable analogs of these unique molecules. However, bovine milk has a much lower concentration of these oligosaccharides than human milk, and the majority of the molecules are simpler in structure than those found in human milk. Specific structural characteristics of milk-derived oligosaccharides are crucial to their ability to selectively enrich beneficial bacteria while inhibiting or being less than ideal substrates for undesirable and pathogenic bacteria. Thus, if bovine milk products are to provide human milk-like benefits, it is important to identify specific dairy streams that can be processed commercially and cost-effectively and that can yield specific oligosaccharide compositions that will be beneficial as new food ingredients or supplements to improve human health. Whey streams have the potential to be commercially viable sources of complex oligosaccharides that have the structural resemblance and diversity of the bioactive oligosaccharides in human milk. With further refinements to dairy stream processing techniques and functional testing to identify streams that are particularly suitable for enriching beneficial intestinal bacteria, the future of oligosaccharides isolated from dairy streams as a food category with substantiated health claims is promising.|Core A|2011|Adv Nutr (Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.))||Zivkovic, Barile.

Ca2+ Influx via the Na+/Ca2+ Exchanger Is Enhanced in Malignant Hyperthermia Skeletal Muscle|Altamirano, Francisco; Eltit, José M.; Robin, Gaëlle; Linares, Nancy; Ding, Xudong; Pessah, Isaac N.; Allen, Paul D.; López, José R.||Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is potentially fatal pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle caused by intracellular Ca(2+) dysregulation. NCX is a bidirectional transporter that effluxes (forward mode) or influxes (reverse mode) Ca(2+) depending on cellular activity. Resting intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)]r) and sodium ([Na(+)]r) concentrations are elevated in MH susceptible (MHS) swine and murine muscles compared with their normal (MHN) counterparts, although the contribution of NCX is unclear. Lowering [Na(+)]e elevates [Ca(2+)]r in both MHN and MHS swine muscle fibers and it is prevented by removal of extracellular Ca(2+) or reduced by t-tubule disruption, in both genotypes. KB-R7943, a nonselective NCX3 blocker, reduced [Ca(2+)]r in both swine and murine MHN and MHS muscle fibers at rest and decreased the magnitude of the elevation of [Ca(2+)]r observed in MHS fibers after exposure to halothane. YM-244769, a high affinity reverse mode NCX3 blocker, reduces [Ca(2+)]r in MHS muscle fibers and decreases the amplitude of [Ca(2+)]r rise triggered by halothane, but had no effect on [Ca(2+)]r in MHN muscle. In addition, YM-244769 reduced the peak and area under the curve of the Ca(2+) transient elicited by high [K(+)]e and increased its rate of decay in MHS muscle fibers. siRNA knockdown of NCX3 in MHS myotubes reduced [Ca(2+)]r and the Ca(2+) transient area induced by high [K(+)]e. These results demonstrate a functional NCX3 in skeletal muscle whose activity is enhanced in MHS. Moreover reverse mode NCX3 contributes to the Ca(2+) transients associated with K(+)-induced depolarization and the halothane-triggered MH episode in MHS muscle fibers.|5|2014|J. Biol. Chem.

Capture and detection of T7 bacteriophages on a nanostructured interface|Han, Jin-Hee; Wang, Min S.; Das, Jayanti; Sudheendra, L.; Vonasek, Erica; Nitin, Nitin; Kennedy, Ian M.||A highly ordered array of T7 bacteriophages was created by the electrophoretic capture of phages onto a nanostructured array with wells that accommodated the phages. Electrophoresis of bacteriophages was achieved by applying a positive potential on an indium tin oxide electrode at the bottom of the nanowells. Nanoscale arrays of phages with different surface densities were obtained by changing the electric field applied to the bottom of the nanowells. The applied voltage was shown to be the critical factor in generating a well-ordered phage array. The number of wells occupied by a phage, and hence the concentration of phages in a sample solution, could be quantified by using a DNA intercalating dye that rapidly stains the T7 phage. The fluorescence signal was enhanced by the intrinsic photonic effect made available by the geometry of the platform. It was shown that the quantification of phages on the array was 6 orders of magnitude better than could be obtained with a fluorescent plate reader. The device opens up the possibility that phages can be detected directly without enrichment or culturing, and by detecting phages that specifically infect bacteria of interest, rapid pathogen detection becomes possible.|2|2014|ACS Appl Mater Interfaces (ACS applied materials & interfaces)||Han, J.

Carbon turnover in the water-soluble protein of the adult human lens|Stewart, Daniel N.; Lango, Jozsef; Nambiar, Krishnan P.; Falso, Miranda J. S.; FitzGerald, Paul G.; Rocke, David M.; Hammock, Bruce D.; Buchholz, Bruce A.||PURPOSE: Human eye lenses contain cells that persist from embryonic development. These unique, highly specialized fiber cells located at the core (nucleus) of the lens undergo pseudo-apoptosis to become devoid of cell nuclei and most organelles. Ostensibly lacking in protein transcriptional capabilities, it is currently believed that these nuclear fiber cells owe their extreme longevity to the perseverance of highly stable and densely packed crystallin proteins. Maintaining the structural and functional integrity of lenticular proteins is necessary to sustain cellular transparency and proper vision, yet the means by which the lens actually copes with a lifetime of oxidative stress, seemingly without any capacity for protein turnover and repair, is not completely understood. Although many years of research have been predicated upon the assumption that there is no protein turnover or renewal in nuclear fiber cells, we investigated whether or not different protein fractions possess protein of different ages by using the (14)C bomb pulse. METHODS: Adult human lenses were concentrically dissected by gently removing the cell layers in water or shaving to the nucleus with a curved micrometer-controlled blade. The cells were lysed, and the proteins were separated into water-soluble and water-insoluble fractions. The small molecules were removed using 3 kDa spin filters. The (14)C/C was measured in paired protein fractions by accelerator mass spectrometry, and an average age for the material within the sample was assigned using the (14)C bomb pulse. RESULTS: The water-insoluble fractions possessed (14)C/C ratios consistent with the age of the cells. In all cases, the water-soluble fractions contained carbon that was younger than the paired water-insoluble fraction. CONCLUSIONS: As the first direct evidence of carbon turnover in protein from adult human nuclear fiber cells, this discovery supports the emerging view of the lens nucleus as a dynamic system capable of maintaining homeostasis in part due to intricate protein transport mechanisms and possibly protein repair. This finding implies that the lens plays an active role in the aversion of age-related nuclear (ARN) cataract.|Core A|2013|Mol. Vis.

The accumulation of eicosanoid metabolites in ischaemic myocardium has been demonstrated in animal models and patients with MI, and it occurs in parallel with the development of irreversible cardiac damage. However, the key question that remains unanswered is whether cardiac-generated eicosanoids are the cause or the consequence of cardiac cell damage in MI. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a clinically relevant animal model of MI and metabolic profiling to monitor the eicosanoid profile in ischaemic myocardium. We demonstrate that ischaemia induces the generation of prostanoids mainly through the cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 pathway in the myocardium. Cardiac-generated prostanoids, particularly prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)), can directly induce apoptosis in cardiac myocytes. This effect involves the up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic gene, Fas ligand (FasL), in a D-type prostanoid receptor-independent manner. The treatment of the MI mice with low-dose aspirin effectively inhibits the ischaemia-induced prostanoid generation and FasL expression in the myocardium, leading to the reduction in cardiac apoptosis following cardiac ischaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac ischaemia results in COX-1-mediated generation of prostanoids, which by inducing cardiac myocyte apoptosis, contribute to the cardiac cell loss following MI. The benefits of low-dose aspirin treatment in MI may be attributable, in part, to the inhibition of cardiac prostanoid generation and attenuation of apoptosis. Further understanding of the mechanisms underlying prostanoid-induced cardiac apoptosis may be of significant value in designing new therapeutic strategies to prevent aberrant cell loss following MI and subsequent progression to heart failure.|Core A|2012|Cardiovasc.

To address the cellular basis for normal exfoliation, we compared changes in lamellar bilayer architecture and CD structure in D-Squame strips from the first versus fifth stripping (""outer"" vs. ""mid""-stratum corneum (SC), respectively) from nine normal adult forearms. Strippings were either processed for standard electron microscopy (EM) or for ruthenium-, or osmium-tetroxide vapor fixation, followed by immediate epoxy embedment, an artifact-free protocol, which, to our knowledge, is previously unreported. CDs are largely intact in the mid-SC, but replaced by electron-dense (hydrophilic) clefts (lacunae) that expand laterally, splitting lamellar arrays in the outer SC. Some undegraded desmoglein 1/desmocollin 1 redistribute uniformly into corneocyte envelopes (CEs) in the outer SC (shown by proteomics, Z-stack confocal imaging, and immunoEM). CEs then thicken, likely facilitating exfoliation by increasing corneocyte rigidity. In vapor-fixed images, hydration only altered the volume of the extracellular compartment, expanding lacunae, further separating membrane arrays.

CH223191 is a ligand-selective antagonist of the Ah (Dioxin) receptor|Zhao, Bin; DeGroot, Danica E.; Hayashi, Ai; He, Guochun; Denison, Michael S.|Animals; Azo Compounds/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology; Cell Line; Environmental Pollutants/chemistry/metabolism/toxicity; Enzyme Inhibitors/classification/metabolism/toxicity; Gene Expression; Guinea Pigs; Humans; Ligands; Male; Mice; Protein Binding; Pyrazoles/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology; Rats; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry; Signal Transduction; Structure-Activity Relationship; Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin/chemistry/metabolism/toxicity; beta-Naphthoflavone/chemistry/metabolism/toxicity|The aryl hydrocarbon (dioxin) receptor (AhR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that produces a wide range of biological and toxic effects in many species and tissues. Whereas the best-characterized high-affinity ligands include structurally related halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (HAHs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the AhR is promiscuous and can also be activated by structurally diverse exogenous and endogenous chemicals. However, little is known about how these diverse ligands actually bind to and activate the AhR. Utilizing AhR ligand binding, DNA binding, and reporter gene expression assays, we have identified a novel ligand-selective antagonist (CH223191) that preferentially inhibits the ability of some classes of AhR agonists (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and related HAHs), but not others (PAHs, flavonoids, or indirubin), to bind to and/or activate the AhR and AhR signal transduction. HAH-specific antagonism of AhR-dependent reporter gene expression by CH223191 was observed with mouse, rat, human, and guinea pig cell lines. Ligand- and species-selective antagonism was also observed with the AhR antagonists 3'-methoxy-4'-nitroflavone and 6,2',4',-trimethoxyflavone. Our results suggest that the differences in the binding by various ligands to the AhR contribute to the observed structural diversity of AhR ligands and could contribute in ligand-specific variation in AhR functionality and the toxic and biological effects of various classes of AhR agonists.|5|2010|Toxicol.

Changes in soil microbial community structure following the abandonment of agricultural terraces in mountainous areas of Eastern Spain|Zornoza, R.; Guerrero, C.; Mataix-Solera, J.; Scow, K. M.; Arcenegui, V.; Mataix-Beneyto, J.||In Eastern Spain, almond trees have been cultivated in terraced orchards for centuries, forming an integral part of the Mediterranean forest scene. In the last decades, orchards have been abandoned due to changes in society. This study investigates effects of changes in land use from forest to agricultural land and the posterior land abandonment on soil microbial community, and the influence of soil physico-chemical properties on the microbial community composition (assessed as abundances of phospholipids fatty acids, PLFA). For this purpose, three land uses (forest, agricultural and abandoned agricultural) at four locations in SE Spain were selected. Multivariate analysis showed a substantial level of differentiation in microbial community structure according to land use. The microbial communities of forest soils were highly associated with soil organic matter content. However, we have not found any physical or chemical soil property capable of explaining the differences between agricultural and abandoned agricultural soils. Thus, it was suggested that the cessation of the perturbation caused by agriculture and shifts in vegetation may have led to changes in the microbial community structure. PLFAs indicative of fungi and ratio of fungal to bacterial PLFAs were higher in abandoned agricultural soils, whereas the relative abundance of bacteria was higher in agricultural soils. Actinomycetes were generally lower in abandoned agricultural soils, while the proportions of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhyzal fungi were, as a general trend, higher in agricultural and abandoned agricultural soils than in forests. Total microbial biomass and richness increased as agricultural < abandoned agricultural < forest soils.|1|2009|Applied soil ecology : a section of Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment (Appl Soil Ecol)||Zornoza, Guerrero, Mataix-Solera, Scow, Arcenegui, Mataix-Beneyto.

Characterization of Hovi-mEH1, a microsomal epoxide hydrolase from the glassy-winged sharpshooter Homalodisca vitripennis|Kamita, Shizuo G.; Oshita, Grant H.; Wang, Peng; Morisseau, Christophe; Hammock, Bruce D.; Nandety, Raja Sekhar; Falk, Bryce W.||Epoxide hydrolase (EH) is an enzyme in the α/β-hydrolase fold superfamily that uses a water molecule to transform an epoxide to its corresponding diol. In insects, EHs metabolize among other things critical developmental hormones called juvenile hormones (JHs). EHs also play roles in the detoxification of toxic compounds that are found in the insect's diet or environment. In this study, a full-length cDNA encoding an epoxide hydrolase, Hovi-mEH1, was obtained from the xylem-feeding insect Homalodisca vitripennis. H. vitripennis, commonly known as the glassy-winged sharpshooter, is an economically important vector of plant pathogenic bacteria such as Xylella fastidiosa. Hovi-mEH1 hydrolyzed the general EH substrates cis-stilbene oxide and trans-diphenylpropene oxide with specific activities of 47.5 ± 6.2 and 1.3 ± 0.5 nmol of diol formed min(-1) mg(-1) , respectively. Hovi-mEH1 metabolized JH III with a Vmax of 29.3 ± 1.6 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) , kcat of 0.03 s(-1) , and KM of 13.8 ± 2.0 μM. These Vmax and kcat values are similar to those of known JH metabolizing EHs from lepidopteran and coleopteran insects. Hovi-mEH1 showed 99.1% identity to one of three predicted EH-encoding sequences that were identified in the transcriptome of H. vitripennis. Of these three sequences only Hovi-mEH1 clustered with known JH metabolizing EHs.

To this end, the samples were separated first into solubilized and particulate fractions, the latter enriched in isopeptide cross-linking, by exhaustive extraction in sodium dodecyl sulfate under reducing conditions. Among the 205 proteins identified were 17 keratins (types alpha and beta), 51 involved in protein synthesis, 8 junctional, 8 histone, 5 heat shock, and 5 14-3-3 proteins. Considerable overlap among the beak, claw, feather, and scale samples was observed in protein profiles, but those from beak and claw were the most similar. Scale and feather profiles were the most distinctive, each exhibiting specific proteins. Less than 20% of the proteins were found only in the detergent-solubilized fraction, while 34-57% were found only in the particulate fraction, depending on the source, and the rest in both fractions. The results provide the first comprehensive analysis of the content of these cornified structures, reveal the efficient use of available proteins in conferring mechanical and chemical stability to them, and emphasize the importance of isopeptide cross-linking in avian epithelial cornification.|5|2013|J Proteome Res (Journal of proteome research)||Rice, Winters, Durbin-Johnson, Rocke.

Cloning and characterization of a microsomal epoxide hydrolase from Heliothis virescens|Kamita, Shizuo G.; Yamamoto, Kohji; Dadala, Mary M.; Pha, Khavong; Morisseau, Christophe; Escaich, Aurélie; Hammock, Bruce D.||Epoxide hydrolases (EHs) are α/β-hydrolase fold superfamily enzymes that convert epoxides to 1,2-trans diols. In insects EHs play critical roles in the metabolism of toxic compounds and allelochemicals found in the diet and for the regulation of endogenous juvenile hormones (JHs). In this study we obtained a full-length cDNA, hvmeh1, from the generalist feeder Heliothis virescens that encoded a highly active EH, Hv-mEH1. Of the 10 different EH substrates that were tested, Hv-mEH1 showed the highest specific activity (1180 nmol min(-1) mg(-1)) for a 1,2-disubstituted epoxide-containing fluorescent substrate. This specific activity was more than 25- and 3900-fold higher than that for the general EH substrates cis-stilbene oxide and trans-stilbene oxide, respectively. Although phylogenetic analysis placed Hv-mEH1 in a clade with some lepidopteran JH metabolizing EHs (JHEHs), JH III was a relatively poor substrate for Hv-mEH1. Hv-mEH1 showed a unique substrate selectivity profile for the substrates tested in comparison to those of MsJHEH, a well-characterized JHEH from Manduca sexta, and hmEH, a human microsomal EH. Hv-mEH1 also showed unique enzyme inhibition profiles to JH-like urea, JH-like secondary amide, JH-like primary amide, and non-JH-like primary amide compounds in comparison to MsJHEH and hmEH. Although Hv-mEH1 is capable of metabolizing JH III, our findings suggest that this enzymatic activity does not play a significant role in the metabolism of JH in the caterpillar. The ability of Hv-mEH1 to rapidly hydrolyze 1,2-disubstituted epoxides suggests that it may play roles in the metabolism of fatty acid epoxides such as those that are commonly found in the diet of Heliothis.|5|2013|Insect Biochem.

The present studies were performed in Ren-2 renin transgenic rats (TGR) to evaluate the effects of chronic selective inhibition of 20-HETE formation or elevation of the level of EETs, alone or in combination, on the course of hypertension and hypertension-associated end-organ damage. Both young (30 days of age) prehypertensive TGR and adult (190 days of age) TGR with established hypertension were examined. Normotensive HanSD (Hannover Sprague-Dawley) rats served as controls. The rats were treated with N-methylsulfonyl-12,12-dibromododec-11-enamide to inhibit 20-HETE formation and/or with N-cyclohexyl-N-dodecyl urea to inhibit soluble epoxide hydrolase and prevent degradation of EETs. Inhibition in TGR of 20-HETE formation combined with enhanced bioavailability of EETs attenuated the development of hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, proteinuria, glomerular hypertrophy and sclerosis as well as renal tubulointerstitial injury. This was also associated with attenuation of the responsiveness of the systemic and renal vascular beds to AngII without modifying their responses to noradrenaline (norepinephrine). Our findings suggest that altered production and/or action of 20-HETE and EETs plays a permissive role in the development of hypertension and hypertension-associated end-organ damage in this model of AngII-dependent hypertension. This information provides a basis for a search for new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of hypertension.|Core A|2010|Clin. Sci.

Exposure to ultrafine PM is correlated with respiratory infections and asthmatic symptoms in young children. The lung undergoes substantial growth, alveolarization, and cellular maturation within the first years of life, which may be impacted by environmental pollutants such as PM. PAHs in PM can serve as ligands for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) that induces expression of certain isozymes in the cytochrome P-450 superfamily, such as CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, localized in specific lung cell types. Although AhR activation and induction has been widely studied, its context within PM exposure and impact on the developing lung is poorly understood. In response, we have developed a replicable ultrafine premixed flame particle (PFP) generating system and used in vitro and in vivo models to define PM effects on AhR activation in the developing lung. We exposed 7-day neonatal and adult rats to a single 6-h PFP exposure and determined that PFPs cause significant parenchymal toxicity in neonates. PFPs contain weak AhR agonists that upregulate AhR-xenobiotic response element activity and expression and are capable inducers of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 expression in both ages with different spatial and temporal patterns. Neonatal CYP1A1 expression was muted and delayed compared with adults, possibly because of differences in the enzyme maturation. We conclude that the inability of neonates to sufficiently adapt in response to PFP exposure may, in part, explain their susceptibility to PFP and urban ultrafine PM.|4|2013|Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol (American journal of physiology)||Chan, Vogel, Baek, Kodani, Uppal, Bein, Anderson, van Winkle.

Although PM originates from natural and anthropogenic sources, vehicle exhaust rich in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) can be a dominant contributor to the PM2.5 and PM0.1 fractions and has been implicated in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). OBJECTIVES: Current studies of ambient PM are confounded by the variable nature of PM, so we utilized a previously characterized ethylene-combusted premixed flame particles (PFP) with consistent and reproducible physiochemical properties and 1) measured the oxidative potential of PFP compared to ambient PM, 2) determined the ability of PFPs to generate oxidative stress and activate the transcription factor using in vitro and ex vivo models, and 3) we correlated these responses with antioxidant enzyme expression in vivo. METHODS: We compared oxidative stress response (HMOX1) and antioxidant enzyme (SOD1, SOD2, CAT, and PRDX6) expression in vivo by performing a time-course study in 7-day old neonatal and young adult rats exposed to a single 6-hour exposure to 22.4 μg/m3 PFPs. RESULTS: We showed that PFP is a potent ROS generator that induces oxidative stress and activates Nrf2. Induction of the oxidative stress responsive enzyme HMOX1 in vitro was mediated through Nrf2 activation and was variably upregulated in both ages. Furthermore, antioxidant enzyme expression had age and lung compartment variations post exposure. Of particular interest was SOD1, which had mRNA and protein upregulation in adult parenchyma, but lacked a similar response in neonates. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that PFPs are effective ROS generators, comparable to urban ambient PM2.5, that induce oxidative stress in neonatal and adult rat lungs. PFPs upregulate a select set of antioxidant enzymes in young adult animals, that are unaffected in neonates. We conclude that the inability of neonatal animals to upregulate the antioxidant response may, in part, explain enhanced their susceptibility to ultrafine particles, such as PFP.|4|2013|Part Fibre Toxicol (Particle and fibre toxicology)||Chan, Jackie K W, Charrier, Kodani, Vogel, Kado, Anderson, Anastasio, Van Winkle, Laura S.

While recent studies have shown that the AhR can bind and be activated by structurally diverse chemicals, how widespread of these AhR agonists are in environmental, biological and synthetic materials remains to be determined. Using AhR-based assays, we demonstrate the presence of potent AhR agonists in a variety of common commercial and consumer items. Solvent extracts of paper, rubber and plastic products contain chemicals that can bind to and stimulate AhR DNA binding and/or AhR-dependent gene expression in hepatic cytosol, cultured cell lines, human epidermis and zebrafish embryos. In contrast to TCDD and other persistent dioxin-like HAHs, activation of AhR-dependent gene expression by these extracts was transient, suggesting that the agonists are metabolically labile. Solvent extracts of rubber products produce AhR-dependent developmental toxicity in zebrafish in vivo, and inhibition of expression of the metabolic enzyme CYP1A, significantly increased their toxic potency. Although the identity of the responsible AhR-active chemicals and their toxicological impact remain to be determined, our data demonstrate that AhR active chemicals are widely distributed in everyday products.|5|2013|PLoS ONE (PloS one)||Zhao, Bohonowych, Timme-Laragy, Jung, Affatato, Rice, Di Giulio, Denison.

Comparative analysis of homology models of the AH receptor ligand binding domain: verification of structure-function predictions by site-directed mutagenesis of a nonfunctional receptor|Fraccalvieri, Domenico; Soshilov, Anatoly A.; Karchner, Sibel I.; Franks, Diana G.; Pandini, Alessandro; Bonati, Laura; Hahn, Mark E.; Denison, Michael S.|Amino Acid Motifs; Amino Acid Sequence; Amino Acid Substitution; Animals; Avian Proteins/chemistry/genetics/physiology; Binding Sites; COS Cells; Cercopithecus aethiops; Environmental Pollutants/chemistry; Humans; Ligands; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/chemistry/genetics/physiology; Structural Homology, Protein; Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin/chemistry; Transcriptional Activation; Zebrafish Proteins/chemistry/genetics/physiology|The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that mediates the biological and toxic effects of a wide variety of structurally diverse chemicals, including the toxic environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). While significant interspecies differences in AHR ligand binding specificity, selectivity, and response have been observed, the structural determinants responsible for those differences have not been determined, and homology models of the AHR ligand-binding domain (LBD) are available for only a few species. Here we describe the development and comparative analysis of homology models of the LBD of 16 AHRs from 12 mammalian and nonmammalian species and identify the specific residues contained within their ligand binding cavities. The ligand-binding cavity of the fish AHR exhibits differences from those of mammalian and avian AHRs, suggesting a slightly different TCDD binding mode. Comparison of the internal cavity in the LBD model of zebrafish (zf) AHR2, which binds TCDD with high affinity, to that of zfAHR1a, which does not bind TCDD, revealed that the latter has a dramatically shortened binding cavity due to the side chains of three residues (Tyr296, Thr386, and His388) that reduce the amount of internal space available to TCDD. Mutagenesis of two of these residues in zfAHR1a to those present in zfAHR2 (Y296H and T386A) restored the ability of zfAHR1a to bind TCDD and to exhibit TCDD-dependent binding to DNA. These results demonstrate the importance of these two amino acids and highlight the predictive potential of comparative analysis of homology models from diverse species. The availability of these AHR LBD homology models will facilitate in-depth comparative studies of AHR ligand binding and ligand-dependent AHR activation and provide a novel avenue for examining species-specific differences in AHR responsiveness.|5|2013|Biochemistry (Biochemistry)||Fraccalvieri, Soshilov, Karchner, Franks, Pandini, Bonati, Hahn, Denison.

Comparative efficacy of 3 soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors in rat neuropathic and inflammatory pain models|Wagner, Karen; Inceoglu, Bora; Dong, Hua; Yang, Jun; Hwang, Sung Hee; Jones, Paul; Morisseau, Christophe; Hammock, Bruce D.||Epoxy-fatty acids have been recognized as important cell signaling molecules with multiple biological effects including anti-nociception. The main degradation pathway of these signaling molecules is via the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) enzyme. Inhibitors of sEH extend the anti-nociceptive effects of fatty acid epoxides. In this study two models of pain with different etiology, streptozocin induced type I diabetic neuropathic pain and lipopolysaccharide induced inflammatory pain were employed to test sEH inhibitors. A dose range of three sEH inhibitors with the same central pharmacophore but varying substituent moieties was used to investigate maximal anti-allodynic effects in these two models of pain. Inhibiting the sEH enzyme in these models successfully blocked pain related behavior in both models. The sEH inhibitors were more potent and more efficacious than celecoxib in reducing both diabetic neuropathic pain and lipopolysaccharide induced inflammatory pain.

The primary goals of this study were to test single and multiparameter linear free energy relationships on their ability to predict the observed sorption behavior on different types of natural sorbents across a range of solutes and concentrations and to relate the accuracy of the predictions to sorbent and solute structural descriptors. Organic carbon normalized sorption coefficients (K(OC)) predicted using both single and multiparameter LFERs were in good agreement with experimental data obtained at the highest tested aqueous concentrations (average deviation less than 0.1 log units over all solutes and sorbents), but deviations were more substantial (0.59-0.65 log units) at the lowest tested concentrations. For chlorinated benzenes there was a significant correlation between experiment-prediction discrepancies and the aromatic content of the soil organic matter measured by (13)C NMR, and the magnitude of the effect was similar to that observed previously for dissolved organic matter.|1|2010|Environ.

Comparison of free serum oxylipin concentrations in hyper- vs. normolipidemic men|Schuchardt, Jan Philipp; Schmidt, Simone; Kressel, Gaby; Dong, Hua; Willenberg, Ina; Hammock, Bruce D.; Hahn, Andreas; Schebb, Nils Helge||Oxylipins, the oxidation products of unsaturated fatty acids (FA), are potent endogenous mediators being involved in the regulation of various biological processes such as inflammation, pain and blood coagulation. Compared to oxylipins derived from arachidonic acid (AA) by cyclooxygenase action, i.e. prostanoides, only limited information is available about the endogenous levels of hydroxy-, epoxy- and dihydroxy-FA of linoleic acid (LA), AA, α-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in humans. Particularly, it is unknown how metabolic disorders affect endogenous oxylipin levels in humans. Therefore, in the present study we compared the serum concentrations of 44 oxylipins in 20 normolipidemic with 20 hyperlipidemic (total cholesterol >200mg/dl; LDL-C>130mg/dl; TG>150mg/dl) men (age 29-51y). The serum concentration varied strongly among subjects. For most hydroxy-, epoxy- and dihydroxy-FA the concentrations were comparable to those in plasma reported in earlier studies. Despite the significant change in blood lipid levels the hyperlipidemic group showed only minor differences in oxylipin levels. The hyperlipidemic subjects had a slightly higher serum concentration of 8,9-DiHETrE, 5-HEPE, 10,11-DiHDPE, and a lower concentration of 12,13-DiHOME, 12-HETE, 9,10-DiHODE, and 12,13-DiHODE compared to normolipidemic subjects. Overall the hydroxy-, epoxy- and dihydroxy-FA levels were not changed suggesting that mild combined hyperlipidemia has no apparent effect on the concentration of circulating oxylipins. By contrast, serum levels of several hydroxy-, epoxy-, and dihydroxy-FA are dependent on the individual status of the parent FA. Particularly, a strong correlation between the EPA content in the erythrocyte membrane and the serum concentration of EPA derived oxylipins was observed. Given that the synthesis of EPA from other n-3 FA in humans is low; this suggests that oxylipin levels can be directly influenced by the diet.|Core A|2013|Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent.

Comparison of the effects of long-chain omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on plasma levels of free and esterified oxylipins|Schebb, Nils Helge; Ostermann, Annika I.; Yang, Jun; Hammock, Bruce D.; Hahn, Andreas; Schuchardt, Jan Philipp||INTRODUCTION: It is believed that many of the beneficial effects of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA) are mediated by their oxidized metabolites, the oxylipins. The formation and biological role of many cytochrome P450 and lipoxygenase derived hydroxy, epoxy and dihydroxy FA, particularly of oxylipins esterified in polar lipids and triglycerides remain unclear. In this study, we compared the impact of twelve weeks of LC n-3 PUFA supplementation on the patterns of free and total (sum of esterified and free) hydroxy, epoxy and dihydroxy FAs. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects (5 male; 5 female) between 46 and 70 years were supplemented with 1.1g/d of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 0.74g/d docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as ethyl esters. Blood samples were drawn before and after twelve weeks of treatment. Oxylipins in plasma were analyzed by LC-MS directly for free oxylipins and after saponification. Relative FA composition in erythrocyte membranes was analyzed by GC. RESULTS: LC n-3 PUFA treatment led to a significant increase in EPA (200%) and DHA (23%) in erythrocyte membranes. Of the oxylipins measured in plasma, total and free EPA-derived metabolites were highly increased (70-150%), while total AA-derived metabolites were decreased on average by 30%. There was no effect on DHA-metabolites. Concentrations of total hydroxy and epoxy FAs in plasma were considerably higher compared to free hydroxy and epoxy FAs (up to 350 times), while levels of most free dihydroxy FAs were in a similar range to total dihydroxy FAs. However, the individual ratios between total and free plasma oxylipins remained unchanged after LC n-3 PUFA treatment. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: LC n-3 PUFA supplementation causes a shift in the levels of circulating oxylipins, having the strongest impact on EPA-derived epoxy, dihydroxy and hydroxy FA. The unchanged ratio of free and esterified oxylipins in plasma indicates that both concentrations are valuable biomarkers for assessing the individual status of these lipid mediators.|Core A|2014|Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat.

Compensatory proteome adjustments imply tissue-specific structural and metabolic reorganization following episodic hypoxia or anoxia in the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum)|Dowd, W.

We used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry-based proteomics approaches, combined with a suite of physiological measures, to characterize this species' responses to 1) one episode of anoxia plus normoxic recovery, 2) one episode of severe hypoxia plus recovery, or 3) two episodes of severe hypoxia plus recovery. We examined these responses in the cerebellum and rectal gland, two tissues with high ATP requirements. Sharks maintained plasma ionic homeostasis following all treatments, and activities of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and caspase 3/7 in both tissues were unchanged. Oxygen lack and reoxygenation elicited subtle adjustments in the proteome. Hypoxia led to more extensive proteome responses than anoxia in both tissues. The cerebellum and rectal gland exhibited treatment-specific responses to oxygen limitation consistent with one or more of several strategies: 1) neurotransmitter and receptor downregulation in cerebellum to prevent excitotoxicity, 2) cytoskeletal/membrane reorganization, 3) metabolic reorganization and more efficient intracellular energy shuttling that are more consistent with sustained ATP turnover than with long-term metabolic depression, 4) detoxification of metabolic byproducts and oxidative stress in light of continued metabolic activity, particularly following hypoxia in rectal gland, and 5) activation of prosurvival signaling. We hypothesize that neuronal morphological changes facilitate prolonged protection from excitotoxicity via dendritic spine remodeling in cerebellum (i.e., synaptic structural plasticity). These results recapitulate several highly conserved themes in the anoxia and hypoxia tolerance, preconditioning, and oxidative stress literature in a single system. In addition, several of the identified pathways and proteins suggest potentially novel mechanisms for enhancing anoxia or hypoxia tolerance in vertebrates. Overall, our data show that episodic hypoxic or anoxic exposure and recovery in the epaulette shark amplifies a constitutive suite of compensatory mechanisms that further prepares them for subsequent insults.|Core B|2010|Physiol.

The ICA test strip consisted of a membrane with a detection zone, a sample pad and an absorbent pad. The membrane was separately coated with chlorpyrifos Hapten-OVA conjugate (test line) and anti-mouse IgG (control line). Based on the fact that the competition is between the migrating analyte in the sample and the analyte hapten immobilized on the test strip for the binding sites of the antibody-colloidal gold (Ab-CG) conjugate migrating on the test strip, this study suggests that the relative migration speed between the two migrating substances is a critically important factor for the sensitive detection by competitive ICA. This criterion was utilized for the confirmation of appropriateness of a nitrocellulose (NC) membrane for chlorpyrifos ICA. The detection limit of the ICA for chlorpyrifos standard and chlorpyrifos spiked into agricultural samples were 10 and 50 ng mL(-1), respectively. The assay time for the ICA test was less than 10 min, suitable for rapid on-site testing of chlorpyrifos.|3|2011|Anal. Chim. Acta (Analytica chimica acta)||Kim, Lee, Kim, Lee, Hammock, Lee. (2011).

Concentrations of the urinary pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxybenzoic acid in farm worker families in the MICASA study|Trunnelle, Kelly J.; Bennett, Deborah H.; Ahn, Ki Chang; Schenker, Marc B.; Tancredi, Daniel J.; Gee, Shirley J.; Stoecklin-Marois, Maria T.; Hammock, Bruce D.|Adult; Animals; Benzoates/urine; California; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Male; Mexican Americans/ethnology; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Pesticides; Prospective Studies; Transients and Migrants; Young Adult|Indoor pesticide exposure is a growing concern, particularly from pyrethroids, a commonly used class of pesticides. Pyrethroid concentrations may be especially high in homes of immigrant farm worker families who often live in close proximity to agricultural fields, and are faced with poor housing conditions, causing higher pest infestation and more pesticide use. We investigate exposure of farm worker families to pyrethroids in a study of mothers and children living in Mendota, CA within the population-based Mexican Immigration to California: Agricultural Safety and Acculturation (MICASA) Study. We present pyrethroid exposure based on an ELISA analysis of urinary metabolite 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3PBA) levels among 105 women and 103 children. The median urinary 3PBA levels (children=2.56 ug/g creatinine, mothers=1.46 ug/g creatinine) were higher than those reported in population based studies for the United States general population, but similar to or lower than studies with known high levels of pyrethroid exposure. A positive association was evident between poor housing conditions and the urinary metabolite levels, showing that poor housing conditions are a contributing factor to the higher levels of 3PBA seen in the urine of these farm worker families.

Although reports in the lay and scientific literature suggest therapeutic potential for improving cardiovascular health, the underlying molecular mechanisms of action remain unclear. Previous studies have implicated a wide range of molecular targets in cardiac muscle for the major green tea catechin, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), but effects were observed only at micromolar concentrations of unclear clinical relevance. Here, we report that nanomolar concentrations of EGCG significantly enhance contractility of intact murine myocytes by increasing electrically evoked Ca(2+) transients, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) content, and ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) channel open probability. Voltage-clamp experiments demonstrate that 10 nM EGCG significantly inhibits the Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger. Of importance, other Na(+) and Ca(2+) handling proteins such as Ca(2+)-ATPase, Na(+)-H(+) exchanger, and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase were not affected by EGCG ≤ 1 μM. Thus, nanomolar EGCG increases contractility in intact myocytes by coordinately modulating SR Ca(2+) loading, RyR2-mediated Ca(2+) release, and Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange. Inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity probably contributes to the positive inotropic effects observed at EGCG concentrations >1 μM. These newly recognized actions of nanomolar and micromolar EGCG should be considered when the therapeutic and toxicological potential of green tea supplementation is evaluated and may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for improving contractile function in heart failure.|5|2012|Mol.

Corncob bedding alters the effects of estrogens on aggressive behavior and reduces estrogen receptor-α expression in the brain|Villalon Landeros, Rosalina; Morisseau, Christophe; Yoo, Hyun Ju; Fu, Samuel H.; Hammock, Bruce D.; Trainor, Brian C.|Aggression/drug effects; Animals; Behavior, Animal/physiology; Brain/metabolism/physiology; Estrogen Antagonists/pharmacology; Estrogen Receptor alpha/genetics/metabolism; Fadrozole/pharmacology; Furans/blood; Gene Expression Regulation/physiology; Housing, Animal; Male; Peromyscus/physiology; Random Allocation; Zea mays/chemistry|There is growing appreciation that estrogen signaling pathways can be modulated by naturally occurring environmental compounds such as phytoestrogens and the more recently discovered xenoestrogens. Many researchers studying the effects of estrogens on brain function or behavior in animal models choose to use phytoestrogen-free food for this reason. Corncob bedding is commonly used in animal facilities across the United States and has been shown to inhibit estrogen-dependent reproductive behavior in rats. The mechanism for this effect was unclear, because the components of corncob bedding mediating this effect did not bind estrogen receptors. Here, we show in the California mouse (Peromyscus californicus) that estrogens decrease aggression when cardboard-based bedding is used but that this effect is absent when corncob bedding is used. California mice housed on corncob bedding also had fewer estrogen receptor-α-positive cells in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and ventromedial hypothalamus compared with mice housed on cardboard-based bedding. In addition, corncob bedding suppressed the expression of phosphorylated ERK in these brain regions as well as in the medial amygdala and medial preoptic area. Previous reports of the effects of corncob bedding on reproductive behavior are not widely appreciated. Our observations on the effects of corncob bedding on behavior and brain function should draw attention to the importance that cage bedding can exert on neuroendocrine research.|5|2012|Endocrinology (Endocrinology)||Villalon Landeros, Morisseau, Yoo, Fu, Hammock, Trainor.

Cytochrome p450 mRNA expression in the rodent brain: species-, sex-, and region-dependent differences|Stamou, Marianna; Wu, Xianai; Kania-Korwel, Izabela; Lehmler, Hans-Joachim; Lein, Pamela J.||Cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes play a critical role in the activation and detoxication of many neurotoxic chemicals. Although research has largely focused on P450-mediated metabolism in the liver, emerging evidence suggests that brain P450s influence neurotoxicity by modulating local metabolite levels. As a first step toward better understanding the relative role of brain P450s in determining neurotoxic outcome, we characterized mRNA expression of specific P450 isoforms in the rodent brain. Adult mice (male and female) and rats (male) were treated with vehicle, phenobarbital, or dexamethasone. Transcripts for CYP2B, CYP3A, CYP1A2, and the orphan CYP4X1 and CYP2S1 were quantified in the liver, hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum by quantitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction. These P450s were all detected in the liver with the exception of CYP4X1, which was detected in rat but not mouse liver. P450 expression profiles in the brain varied regionally. With the exception of the hippocampus, there were no sex differences in regional brain P450 expression profiles in mice; however, there were marked species differences. In the liver, phenobarbital induced CYP2B expression in both species. Dexamethasone induced hepatic CYP2B and CYP3A in mice but not rats. In contrast, brain P450s did not respond to these classic hepatic P450 inducers. Our findings demonstrate that P450 mRNA expression in the brain varies by region, regional brain P450 profiles vary between species, and their induction varies from that of hepatic P450s. These novel data will be useful for designing mechanistic studies to examine the relative role of P450-mediated brain metabolism in neurotoxicity.|5|2014|Drug Metab. Dispos.

Such a response in surgically and chemically castrated animals will provide proof of concept and a validated animal model for future studies to explore the rise in DHEAS during the menopausal transition of women. METHODS: Twenty-four 18- to 26-year-old female cynomolgus monkeys were screened for ovarian function and then either ovariectomized (n = 4) or treated with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa; n = 20) to block ovarian steroid production. After a recovery period from surgical procedure or down-regulation, a single-dose challenge (1,000 IU/animal, IM) of hCG was then administered to determine if luteinizing hormone (LH)/chorionic gonadotropin could accelerate circulating DHEAS production. Serum DHEAS, bioactive LH, and urinary metabolites of ovarian sex steroids were monitored before, during, and after these treatments. RESULTS: Circulating LH bioactivity and immunoreactive DHEAS concentrations were suppressed in all animals 14 days postadministration of GnRHa. Urinary metabolites of estradiol and progesterone remained low after the surgical procedure or a flare reaction to GnRHa. Circulating DHEAS levels were increased after hCG administration, and the increase in individual animals was proportional to the pretreatment DHEAS at baseline. Circulating DHEAS concentrations were positively correlated to endogenous LH bioactive concentrations prior to hCG challenge and were subsequently further elevated by the hCG challenge while no concomitant change in ovarian steroid hormone excretion was observed. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a positive adrenal androgen response to LH/chorionic gonadotropin in older female higher primates and suggest a mechanism for the rise in adrenal androgen production during the menopausal transition in women. These results also illustrate that the nonhuman primate animal model can be effectively used to investigate this phenomenon.|6|2013|Menopause (Menopause (New York, N)||Moran, Chen, Gee, Lohstroh, Lasley.

Derivation and osmotolerance characterization of three immortalized tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) cell lines|Gardell, Alison M.; Qin, Qin; Rice, Robert H.; Li, Johnathan; Kültz, Dietmar||Fish cell cultures are becoming more widely used models for investigating molecular mechanisms of physiological response to environmental challenge. In this study, we derived two immortalized Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) cell lines from brain (OmB) and lip epithelium (OmL), and compared them to a previously immortalized bulbus arteriosus (TmB) cell line. The OmB and OmL cell lines were generated without or with Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor/3T3 feeder layer supplementation. Although both approaches were successful, ROCK inhibitor/feeder layer supplementation was found to offer the advantages of selecting for epithelial-like cell type and decreasing time to immortalization. After immortalization (≥ passage 5), we characterized the proteomes of the newly derived cell lines (OmB and OmL) using LCMS and identified several unique cell markers for each line. Subsequently, osmotolerance for each of the three cell lines following acute exposure to elevated sodium chloride was evaluated. The acute maximum osmotolerance of these tilapia cell lines (>700 mOsm/kg) was markedly higher than that of any other known vertebrate cell line, but was significantly higher in the epithelial-like OmL cell line. To validate the physiological relevance of these tilapia cell lines, we quantified the effects of acute hyperosmotic challenge (450 mOsm/kg and 700 mOsm/kg) on the transcriptional regulation of two enzymes involved in biosynthesis of the compatible organic osmolyte, myo-inositol. Both enzymes were found to be robustly upregulated in all three tilapia cell lines. Therefore, the newly established tilapia cells lines represent valuable tools for studying molecular mechanisms involved in the osmotic stress response of euryhaline fish.|5|2014|PLoS ONE (PloS one)||Gardell, A.

Desorption of pyrethroids from suspended solids|Fojut, Tessa L.; Young, Thomas M.|Adsorption; Geologic Sediments/chemistry; Insecticides/analysis/chemistry; Kinetics; Models, Chemical; Permethrin/analysis/chemistry; Pyrethrins/analysis/chemistry; Soil/chemistry; Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis/chemistry|Pyrethroid insecticides have been widely detected in sediments at concentrations that can cause toxicity to aquatic organisms. Desorption rates play an important role in determining the bioavailability of hydrophobic organic compounds, such as pyrethroids, because these compounds are more likely to be sorbed to solids in the environment, and times to reach sorptive equilibrium can be long. In the present study, sequential Tenax desorption experiments were performed with three sorbents, three aging times, and four pyrethroids. A biphasic rate model was fit to the desorption data with r(2)  > 0.99, and the rapid and slow compartment desorption rate constants and compartment fractions are reported. Suspended solids from irrigation runoff water collected from a field that had been sprayed with permethrin 1 d before were used in the experiments to compare desorption rates for field-applied pyrethroids with those for laboratory-spiked materials. Suspended solids were used in desorption experiments because suspended solids can be a key source of hydrophobic compounds in surface waters. The rapid desorption rate parameters of field-applied permethrin were not statistically different from those of laboratory spiked permethrin, indicating that desorption of the spiked pyrethroids is comparable to desorption of the pyrethroids added and aged in the field. Sorbent characteristics had the greatest effect on desorption rate parameters; as organic carbon content of the solids increased, the rapid desorption fractions and rapid desorption rate constants both decreased. The desorption rate constant of the slow compartment for sediment containing permethrin aged for 28 d was significantly different compared to aging for 1 d and 7 d, whereas desorption in the rapid and slow compartments did not differ between these treatments.|1|2011|Environ.

Determination of PCDD/Fs, PBDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs in human milk from mothers residing in the rural areas in Flanders, using the CALUX bioassay and GC-HRMS|Croes, K.; Colles, A.; Koppen, G.; Galan, S. de; Vandermarken, T.; Govarts, E.; Bruckers, L.; Nelen, V.; Schoeters, G.; van Larebeke, N.; Denison, M. S.; Mampaey, M.; Baeyens, W.||Since the CALUX (Chemically Activated LUciferase gene eXpression) bioassay is a fast and inexpensive tool for the determination of dioxin-like compounds in a large number of samples and requires only small sample volumes, the use of this technique in human biomonitoring programs provides a good alternative to GC-HRMS. In this study, a new CALUX method for the separate analysis of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs (dl-PCBs) in small amounts of human milk samples with the new sensitive H1L7.5c1 cell line was used to analyze 84 human milk samples, collected from mothers residing in the Flemish rural communities. The geometric mean CALUX-Bioanalytical Equivalent (CALUX-BEQ) values, reported for the 84 mothers from the study area were 10.4 (95% CI: 9.4-11.4) pg CALUX-BEQ per gram lipid or 0.41 (95% CI: 0.37-0.45) pg CALUX-BEQ per gram milk for the PCDD/Fs and 1.73 (1.57-1.91) pg CALUX-BEQ per gram lipid or 0.07 (95% CI: 0.06-0.08) pg CALUX-BEQ per gram milk for the dioxin-like PCBs. Multiple regression analysis showed significant associations between PCDD/Fs and weight change after pregnancy, smoking and consumption of local eggs. One pooled human milk sample was analyzed with both CALUX and GC-HRMS. The ratio of CALUX and GC-HRMS results for this sample were respectively 1.60, 0.58 and 1.23 for the PCDD/Fs, the dl-PCBs and the sum of both fractions, when using the 2005-TEF values. Additionally, also low levels of certain brominated dioxins and furans were detected in the pooled sample with GC-HRMS.|5|2013|Talanta (Talanta)||Croes, Colles, Koppen, Galan, Vandermarken, Govarts, Bruckers, Nelen, Schoeters, van Larebeke, Denison, Mampaey, Baeyens.

Determination of the pyrethroid insecticide metabolite 3-PBA in plasma and urine samples from farmer and consumer groups in northern Thailand|Thiphom, Sarunya; Prapamontol, Tippawan; Chantara, Somporn; Mangklabruks, Ampica; Suphavilai, Chaisuree; Ahn, Ki Chang; Gee, Shirley J.; Hammock, Bruce D.||In this study, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were modified to detect 3-PBA in plasma (including the adducted form) and urine among a large group of consumers and farmers in an agricultural area. The samples were collected on the same day in the morning from 100 consumers (50 females, 50 males) and 100 farmers (50 females, 50 males) in the Fang district, Chiang Mai province, northern Thailand. The ELISA was very sensitive having an IC50 value of 26.7 and 15.3 ng/mL, a limit of quantitation of 5 and 2.5 ng/mL and a limit of detection of 1.08 and 1.94 ng/mL for plasma and urine, respectively. These methods had low (< 5%) intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation. The extraction technique satisfactorily eliminated the matrix effect from samples before ELISA analysis, yielding good recoveries (85.9-99.4% and 87.3-98.0%, respectively). For the volunteer study, the detection rate for plasma 3-PBA was 24% in consumers and 42% in farmers, but the median and range values were similar (median 5.87 ng/mL, range 5.16-8.44 ng/mL in consumers and 6.27 ng/mL, range 4.29-9.57 ng/mL in farmers). The rate of detection in the urine was similar (76% and 69%, in consumers and in farmers), yet the median concentration was significantly higher in farmers (8.86 μg/g creatinine in consumers vs 16.1 μg/g creatinine in farmers) and the range also much wider in farmers (1.62-80.5 μg/g creatinine in consumers and 0.80-256.2 μg/g creatinine in farmers). There was no correlation between plasma 3-PBA and urinary 3-PBA concentrations in the study presumably because plasma 3-PBA is a measure of cumulative exposures while urinary 3-PBA reflects acute exposures. In addition, metabolism and excretion of pyrethroids varies by individual. Nevertheless, this study demonstrated that these volunteers were exposed to pyrethroids.

Development of an online SPE-LC-MS-based assay using endogenous substrate for investigation of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitors|Schebb, Nils Helge; Huby, Marion; Morisseau, Christophe; Hwang, Sung Hee; Hammock, Bruce D.|8,11,14-Eicosatrienoic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism; Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology; Epoxide Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism; Humans; Solid Phase Extraction/methods; Tandem Mass Spectrometry/methods|Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension, pain, and inflammation-related diseases. In order to enable the development of sEH inhibitors (sEHIs), assays are needed for determination of their potency. Therefore, we developed a new method utilizing an epoxide of arachidonic acid (14(15)-EpETrE) as substrate. Incubation samples were directly injected without purification into an online solid phase extraction (SPE) liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS-MS) setup allowing a total run time of only 108 s for a full gradient separation. Analytes were extracted from the matrix within 30 s by turbulent flow chromatography. Subsequently, a full gradient separation was carried out on a 50X2.1 mm RP-18 column filled with 1.7 μm core-shell particles. The analytes were detected with high sensitivity by ESI-MS-MS in SRM mode. The substrate 14(15)-EpETrE eluted at a stable retention time of 96 ± 1 s and its sEH hydrolysis product 14,15-DiHETrE at 63 ± 1 s with narrow peak width (full width at half maximum height: 1.5 ± 0.1 s). The analytical performance of the method was excellent, with a limit of detection of 2 fmol on column, a linear range of over three orders of magnitude, and a negligible carry-over of 0.1% for 14,15-DiHETrE. The enzyme assay was carried out in a 96-well plate format, and near perfect sigmoidal dose-response curves were obtained for 12 concentrations of each inhibitor in only 22 min, enabling precise determination of IC(50) values. In contrast with other approaches, this method enables quantitative evaluation of potent sEHIs with picomolar potencies because only 33 pmol L(-1) sEH were used in the reaction vessel. This was demonstrated by ranking ten compounds by their activity; in the fluorescence method all yielded IC(50) ≤ 1 nmol L(-1). Comparison of 13 inhibitors with IC(50) values >1 nmol L(-1) showed a good correlation with the fluorescence method (linear correlation coefficient 0.9, slope 0.95, Spearman's rho 0.9). For individual compounds, however, up to eightfold differences in potencies between this and the fluorescence method were obtained.

Subsequently, a full gradient separation was carried out on a 50X2.1 mm RP-18 column filled with 1.7 μm core-shell particles. The analytes were detected with high sensitivity by ESI-MS-MS in SRM mode. The substrate 14(15)-EpETrE eluted at a stable retention time of 96 ± 1 s and its sEH hydrolysis product 14,15-DiHETrE at 63 ± 1 s with narrow peak width (full width at half maximum height: 1.5 ± 0.1 s). The analytical performance of the method was excellent, with a limit of detection of 2 fmol on column, a linear range of over three orders of magnitude, and a negligible carry-over of 0.1% for 14,15-DiHETrE. The enzyme assay was carried out in a 96-well plate format, and near perfect sigmoidal dose-response curves were obtained for 12 concentrations of each inhibitor in only 22 min, enabling precise determination of IC(50) values. In contrast with other approaches, this method enables quantitative evaluation of potent sEHIs with picomolar potencies because only 33 pmol L(-1) sEH were used in the reaction vessel. This was demonstrated by ranking ten compounds by their activity; in the fluorescence method all yielded IC(50) ≤ 1 nmol L(-1). Comparison of 13 inhibitors with IC(50) values >1 nmol L(-1) showed a good correlation with the fluorescence method (linear correlation coefficient 0.9, slope 0.95, Spearman's rho 0.9). For individual compounds, however, up to eightfold differences in potencies between this and the fluorescence method were obtained. Therefore, enzyme assays using natural substrate, as described here, are indispensable for reliable determination of structure-activity relationships for sEH inhibition.|Core A|2011|Anal Bioanal Chem (Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry)||Schebb, Huby, Morisseau, Hwang, Hammock.

Development of an ultra fast online-solid phase extraction (SPE) liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) based approach for the determination of drugs in pharmacokinetic studies|Schebb, Nils Helge; Inceoglu, Bora; Rose, Tristan; Wagner, Karen; Hammock, Bruce D.||High-throughput analyses of a large number of samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) studies are essential in drug development. Analysis of drug candidates from blood using LC-ESI-MS generally requires separation of the plasma fraction followed by various offline sample preparation procedures. This step is a bottleneck that impedes throughput. In order to overcome this difficulty and accelerate analysis in PK and other studies, we developed an approach allowing the direct analysis of low volumes of whole blood (10 μL) after dilution and centrifugation. Samples were injected in an online-SPE-LC-ESI-MS/MS setup allowing a total run time of only 126 s for a full gradient separation. Analytes were extracted from the matrix within 30 s by turbulent flow chromatography. Subsequently, a full gradient separation was carried out within 1.5 minutes on a 50 × 2.1 mm (1.7 μm) RP-18 column and the analytes were sensitively detected by ESI-MS/MS in SRM mode. The performance of this new ultra fast online SPE-LC-ESI-MS/MS approach was demonstrated by the analysis of diclofenac (DCF), a widely used anti-inflammatory drug. DCF eluted at stable retention times (±0.33%) with narrow peak width (FWHM 3.3 ± 0.15 s). The method displays excellent analytical performance, with a limit of detection of 6 fmol on column, a linear range of over four orders of magnitude and a negligible carry over of 0.12 ± 0.03% for DCF. The PK profile of DCF administered by topical and intraperitoneal routes in rats and by oral route in one human volunteer is investigated using this method. Finally, general applicability of the approach for drugs is demonstrated by analysis of rofecoxib and several inhibitors of the soluble epoxide hydrolase. This new method requires only readily available, off the shelf standard LC instrumentation, and is compliant with the requirements of green analytical chemistry.|Core A|2011|Anal Methods (Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications)||Schebb, Inceoglu, Rose, Wagner, Hammock.

The purpose of this study was to develop polyclonal antibodies that can stereoselectively recognize proteins modified by styrene oxide enantiomers at cysteine residues. Immunogens were prepared by alkylation of thiolated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) with styrene oxide enantiomers. Polyclonal antibodies were raised by immunization of rabbits with the chiral immunogens. Titration tests showed all six rabbits generated high titers of antisera that recognize (R)- or (S)-coating antigens accordingly. No cross-reaction was observed toward the carrier protein (BSA). All three rabbits immunized with (R)-immunogen produced antibodies that show enantioselectivity to the corresponding antigen, while only one among the three rabbits immunized with (S)-immunogen generated antibodies with enantioselectivity of the recognition. The enantioselectivity was also observed in competitive ELISA and immunoblot analysis. Additionally, competitive ELISA tests showed that the immunorecognition required the hydroxyl group of the haptens.

Development of fluorescent substrates for microsomal epoxide hydrolase and application to inhibition studies|Morisseau, Christophe; Bernay, Maud; Escaich, Aurélie; Sanborn, James R.; Lango, Jozsef; Hammock, Bruce D.|Animals; Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology; Epoxide Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism; Fluorescent Dyes/chemistry/metabolism; Humans; Kinetics; Rats; Substrate Specificity|The microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) plays a significant role in the metabolism of numerous xenobiotics. In addition, it has a potential role in sexual development and bile acid transport, and it is associated with a number of diseases such as emphysema, spontaneous abortion, eclampsia, and several forms of cancer. Toward developing chemical tools to study the biological role of mEH, we designed and synthesized a series of absorbent and fluorescent substrates. The highest activity for both rat and human mEH was obtained with the fluorescent substrate cyano(6-methoxy-naphthalen-2-yl)methyl glycidyl carbonate (11). An in vitro inhibition assay using this substrate ranked a series of known inhibitors similarly to the assay that used radioactive cis-stilbene oxide but with a greater discrimination between inhibitors. These results demonstrate that the new fluorescence-based assay is a useful tool for the discovery of structure-activity relationships among mEH inhibitors. Furthermore, this substrate could also be used for the screening chemical library with high accuracy and with a Z' value of approximately 0.7. This new assay permits a significant decrease in labor and cost and also offers the advantage of a continuous readout. However, it should not be used with crude enzyme preparations due to interfering reactions.|5|2011|Anal. Biochem. (Analytical biochemistry)||Morisseau, Bernay, Escaich, Sanborn, Lango, Hammock.

The on-line biochemical detection system (BCD) was coupled on-line to liquid chromatography (LC) to allow mixture analysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multistage sampling was used to select a representative sample of children 24 to 48 months of age from 2 rural districts in Bangladesh (n = 479). Two nonconsecutive 24-hour periods of dietary data were collected via 12-hour daytime in-home observations and recall. Breast milk intake was estimated using test weighing. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) method for episodically consumed foods was used to estimate distributions of usual food and nutrient intakes. RESULTS: Based on the estimated intake distributions, >95% of the children had usual fat intakes <30% of total energy. Among 24- to 35-month-old (younger) and 36- to 48-month-old (older) children, respectively, 4% and 16% of breast-feeding children and 31% and 41% of non-breast-feeding children were estimated to consume <10% of total energy from fat. An estimated 80% of all of the children consumed <4% of total energy as linoleic acid, and 99% consumed <1% of energy as α-linolenic acid. Younger breast-feeding children had higher estimated average docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) intakes (0.04 g DHA/day) than their non-breast-feeding counterparts (0.01 g DHA/day; P = 0.0005). Both breast-feeding and non-breast-feeding older children had estimated mean DHA intakes of 0.02 g/day (P = 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: Rural Bangladeshi children 24 to 48 months old, and especially those who have discontinued breast-feeding, may benefit from increased fat consumption.|Core A|2011|J. Pediatr.

Differentiating inbred mouse strains from each other and those with single gene mutations using hair proteomics|Rice, Robert H.; Bradshaw, Katie M.; Durbin-Johnson, Blythe P.; Rocke, David M.; Eigenheer, Richard A.; Phinney, Brett S.; Sundberg, John P.||Mutant laboratory mice with distinctive hair phenotypes are useful for identifying genes responsible for hair diseases. The work presented here demonstrates that shotgun proteomic profiling can distinguish hair shafts from different inbred mouse strains. For this purpose, analyzing the total hair shaft provided better discrimination than analyzing the isolated solubilized and particulate (cross-linked) fractions. Over 100 proteins exhibited significant differences among the 11 strains and 5 mutant stocks across the wide spectrum of strains surveyed. Effects on the profile of single gene mutations causing hair shaft defects were profound. Since the hair shaft provides a discrete sampling of the species proteome, with constituents serving important functions in epidermal appendages and throughout the body, this work provides a foundation for non-invasive diagnosis of genetic diseases of hair and perhaps other tissues.|5|2012|PLoS ONE (PloS one)||Rice, Bradshaw, Durbin-Johnson, Rocke, Eigenheer, Phinney, Sundberg.

Dioxin analysis in water by using a passive sampler and CALUX bioassay|Addeck, Amr; Croes, Kim; van Langenhove, Kersten; Denison, Michael; Elskens, Marc; Baeyens, Willy|Aluminum/chemistry; Biological Assay; Carbon/chemistry; Diffusion; Dioxins/analysis; Environmental Monitoring/instrumentation/methods; Groundwater/chemistry; Kinetics; Limit of Detection; Titanium/chemistry; Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis|Passive sampling of organic pollutants is a new trend in environmental monitoring and analysis. Passive samplers are being developed to overcome the drawbacks of the conventional snapshot sampling approach. The ceramic toximeter is a promising passive sampler for monitoring dioxin-contaminated surface and ground waters. It consists of an alumina cylinder lined with a thin coating of titania and a pore diameter of 0.05 μm. The cylinder serves as a diffusion barrier limiting the analyte transport to molecular diffusion only, as well as a container for a selective trapping material of a high capacity and affinity towards the chemical(s) of concern. The cylinder is closed from both sides with PTFE caps. The ceramic toximeter was filled with activated carbon as the trapping material and has been tested in vitro for the sampling of dioxin-contaminated water. In addition, the utilization of the CALUX bioassay technique for analyzing the trapped dioxin has greatly reduced the time and costs for dioxin scanning in aqueous media. Exposure times varied between 1 and 7 days in a solution of 1.35 ng-TCDDL(-1) (TCDD is 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin). The mean effective molecular diffusion coefficient of TCDD in the toximeter amounts to 11.9×10(-6)m(2)d(-1) while the minimum concentration detectable in an aquatic system after 30 days of exposure amounts to 0.89 pg-TCDDL(-1).|5|2012|Talanta (Talanta)||Addeck, Croes, van Langenhove, Denison, Elskens, Baeyens.

Distinguishing ichthyoses by protein profiling|Rice, Robert H.; Bradshaw, Katie M.; Durbin-Johnson, Blythe P.; Rocke, David M.; Eigenheer, Richard A.; Phinney, Brett S.; Schmuth, Matthias; Gruber, Robert||To explore the usefulness of protein profiling for characterization of ichthyoses, we here determined the profile of human epidermal stratum corneum by shotgun proteomics. Samples were analyzed after collection on tape circles from six anatomic sites (forearm, palm, lower leg, forehead, abdomen, upper back), demonstrating site-specific differences in profiles. Additional samples were collected from the forearms of subjects with ichthyosis vulgaris (filaggrin (FLG) deficiency), recessive X-linked ichthyosis (steroid sulfatase (STS) deficiency) and autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis type lamellar ichthyosis (transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) deficiency). The ichthyosis protein expression patterns were readily distinguishable from each other and from phenotypically normal epidermis. In general, the degree of departure from normal was lower from ichthyosis vulgaris than from lamellar ichthyosis, parallel to the severity of the phenotype. Analysis of samples from families with ichthyosis vulgaris and concomitant modifying gene mutations (STS deficiency, GJB2 deficiency) permitted correlation of alterations in protein profile with more complex genetic constellations.|5|2013|PLoS ONE (PloS one)||Rice, Bradshaw, Durbin-Johnson, Rocke, Eigenheer, Phinney, Schmuth, Gruber.

Distribution of pyrethroid insecticides in secondary wastewater effluent|Parry, Emily; Young, Thomas M.||Although the freely dissolved form of hydrophobic organic chemicals may best predict aquatic toxicity, differentiating between dissolved and particle-bound forms is challenging at environmentally relevant concentrations for compounds with low toxicity thresholds such as pyrethroid insecticides. The authors investigated the distribution of pyrethroids among 3 forms: freely dissolved, complexed with dissolved organic carbon, and sorbed to suspended particulate matter, during a yearlong study at a secondary wastewater treatment plant. Effluent was fractionated by laboratory centrifugation to determine whether sorption was driven by particle size. Linear distribution coefficients were estimated for pyrethroid sorption to suspended particulate matter (K(id)) and dissolved organic carbon (K(idoc)) at environmentally relevant pyrethroid concentrations. Resulting K(id) values were higher than those reported for other environmental solids, and variation between sampling events correlated well with available particle surface area. Fractionation results suggest that no more than 40% of the pyrethroid remaining in secondary effluent could be removed by extending settling periods. Less than 6% of the total pyrethroid load in wastewater effluent was present in the dissolved form across all sampling events and chemicals.|1|2013|Environ. Toxicol. Chem.

Dual inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 and soluble epoxide hydrolase synergistically suppresses primary tumor growth and metastasis|Zhang, Guodong; Panigrahy, Dipak; Hwang, Sung Hee; Yang, Jun; Mahakian, Lisa M.; Wettersten, Hiromi I.; Liu, Jun-Yan; Wang, Yanru; Ingham, Elizabeth S.; Tam, Sarah; Kieran, Mark W.; Weiss, Robert H.; Ferrara, Katherine W.; Hammock, Bruce D.||Prostaglandins derived from the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) from the cytochrome P450/soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) pathway are important eicosanoids that regulate angiogenesis and tumorigenesis.

Defects in neuronal morphology, early migration, and electrophysiological activity have been described despite appreciable expression of fragile-X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in a pre-CGG knock-in (KI) mouse model. The triggers that initiate and promote pre-CGG neuronal dysfunction are not understood. The absence of FMRP in a Drosophila model of fragile-X syndrome was shown to increase axonal transport of mitochondria. In this study, we show that dissociated hippocampal neuronal culture from pre-CGG KI mice (average 170 CGG repeats) express 42.6% of the FMRP levels and 3.8-fold higher Fmr1 mRNA than that measured in wild-type neurons at 4 days in vitro. Pre-CGG hippocampal neurons show abnormalities in the number, mobility, and metabolic function of mitochondria at this early stage of differentiation. Pre-CGG hippocampal neurites contained significantly fewer mitochondria and greatly reduced mitochondria mobility. In addition, pre-CGG neurons had higher rates of basal oxygen consumption and proton leak. We conclude that deficits in mitochondrial trafficking and metabolic function occur despite the presence of appreciable FMRP expression and may contribute to the early pathophysiology in pre-CGG carriers and to the risk of developing clinical fragile-X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome.|5|2012|J.

Effect based monitoring of seasonal ambient air exposures in Australia sampled by PUF passive air samplers|Kennedy, Karen; Macova, Miroslava; Bartkow, Michael E.; Hawker, Darryl W.; Zhao, Bin; Denison, Michael S.; Mueller, Jochen F.||There has been relatively little bioanalytical effect based monitoring conducted using samples derived from polyurethane foam (PUF) passive air samplers. Combining these techniques may provide a more convenient and cost effective means of monitoring the potential for biological effects resulting from exposure to complex mixtures in a range of scenarios. Seasonal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) levels were monitored at sites around Australia using direct chemical analysis. In addition, both indirect acting genotoxicity (umuC assay) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activity (chemically activated fluorescent gene expression [CAFLUX assay]), which are effects potentially relevant to subsequent carcinogenesis for these compounds, were measured. The levels of PAHs as well as genotoxicity and AhR activity were all higher in winter compared to summer and for sites in urban capital cities compared to other locations. Statistically significant relationships were found between the levels of PAHs and both genotoxicity and AhR activity. The dominant contributors to the total AhR activity, were found to be for compounds which are not resistant to H(2)SO(4)/silica gel treatment and were relatively rapidly metabolised that is consistent with a PAH type response. Relative potency estimates for individual PAHs determined for the first time on the CAFLUX assay were used to estimate the proportion of total AhR activity (≤ 3.0%) accounted by PAHs monitored. Observed responses are thus largely due to non-quantified AhR active compounds.|5|2010|Atmos Pollut Res (Atmospheric pollution research)||Kennedy, Macova, Bartkow, Hawker, Zhao, Denison, Mueller.

Ceria nanoparticles caused very little inflammatory response in HAECs, even at the highest dose.

Effect of nitrate, acetate, and hydrogen on native perchlorate-reducing microbial communities and their activity in vadose soil|Nozawa-Inoue, Mamie; Jien, Mercy; Yang, Kun; Rolston, Dennis E.; Hristova, Krassimira R.; Scow, Kate M.|Acetates/metabolism; Bacteria/genetics/metabolism; Biodegradation, Environmental; DNA, Bacterial/genetics; Denitrification; Hydrogen/metabolism; Nitrates/metabolism; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidoreductases/genetics; Perchloric Acid/metabolism; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/genetics; Soil/chemistry; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants/metabolism|The effect of nitrate, acetate, and hydrogen on native perchlorate-reducing bacteria (PRB) was examined by conducting microcosm tests using vadose soil collected from a perchlorate-contaminated site. The rate of perchlorate reduction was enhanced by hydrogen amendment and inhibited by acetate amendment, compared with unamendment. Nitrate was reduced before perchlorate in all amendments. In hydrogen-amended and unamended soils, nitrate delayed perchlorate reduction, suggesting that the PRB preferentially use nitrate as an electron acceptor. In contrast, nitrate eliminated the inhibitory effect of acetate amendment on perchlorate reduction and increased the rate and the extent, possibly because the preceding nitrate reduction/denitrification decreased the acetate concentration that was inhibitory to the native PRB. In hydrogen-amended and unamended soils, perchlorate reductase gene (pcrA) copies, representing PRB densities, increased with either perchlorate or nitrate reduction, suggesting that either perchlorate or nitrate stimulates the growth of the PRB. In contrast, in acetate-amended soil pcrA increased only when perchlorate was depleted: a large portion of the PRB may have not utilized nitrate in this amendment. Nitrate addition did not alter the distribution of the dominant pcrA clones in hydrogen-amended soil, likely because of the functional redundancy of PRB as nitrate-reducers/denitrifiers, whereas acetate selected different pcrA clones from those with hydrogen amendment.|1|2011|FEMS Microbiol.

Effect of soluble epoxide hydrolase polymorphism on substrate and inhibitor selectivity and dimer formation|Morisseau, Christophe; Wecksler, Aaron T.; Deng, Catherine; Dong, Hua; Yang, Jun; Lee, Kin Sing S; Kodani, Sean D.; Hammock, Bruce D.||Epoxy FAs (EpFAs) are important lipid mediators that are mainly metabolized by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). Thus, sEH inhibition is a promising therapeutic target to treat numerous ailments. Several sEH polymorphisms result in amino acid substitutions and alter enzyme activity. K55R and R287Q are associated with inflammatory, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases. R287Q seems to affect sEH activity through reducing formation of a catalytically active dimer. Thus, understanding how these SNPs affect the selectivity of sEH for substrates and inhibitors is of potential clinical importance. We investigated the selectivity of four sEH SNPs toward a series of EpFAs and inhibitors. We found that the SNPs alter the catalytic activity of the enzyme but do not alter the relative substrate and inhibitor selectivity. We also determined their dimer/monomer constants (KD/M). The WT sEH formed a very tight dimer, with a KD/M in the low picomolar range. Only R287Q resulted in a large change of the KD/M. However, human tissue concentrations of sEH suggest that it is always in its dimer form independently of the SNP. These results suggest that the different biologies associated with K55R and R287Q are not explained by alteration in dimer formation or substrate selectivity.|5|2014|J. Lipid Res.

Effects of anthocyanins on the AhR-CYP1A1 signaling pathway in human hepatocytes and human cancer cell lines|Kamenickova, Alzbeta; Anzenbacherova, Eva; Pavek, Petr; Soshilov, Anatoly A.; Denison, Michael S.; Zapletalova, Michaela; Anzenbacher, Pavel; Dvorak, Zdenek||Anthocyanins are plant pigments occurring in flowers and berry fruits. Since a phenomenon of food-drug interactions is increasingly emerging, we examined the effects of 21 major anthocyanins and the extracts from 3 food supplements containing anthocyanins on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-cytochrome P450 CYP1A1 signaling pathway in human hepatocytes and human hepatic HepG2 and intestinal LS174T cancer cells. Pelargonidin-3-O-rutinoside (PEL-2) and cyanidin-3,5-O-diglucoside (CYA-3) dose-dependently activated AhR, as revealed by gene reporter assay. PEL-2 and CYA-3 induced CYP1A1 mRNA but not protein in HepG2 and LS174T cells. Neither compounds induced CYP1A1 mRNA and protein in four different primary human hepatocytes cultures. The effects of PEL-2 and CYA-3 on AhR occurred by ligand-dependent and ligand-independent mechanisms, respectively, as demonstrated by ligand binding assay. In a direct enzyme inhibition assay, none of the antocyanins tested inhibited the CYP1A1 marker activity to less than 50% even at 100muM concentration. PEL-2 and CYA-3 at 100muM inhibited CYP1A1 to 79% and 65%, respectively. In conclusion, with exception of PEL-2 and CYA-3, there were no effects of 19 major anthocyanins and 3 food supplements containing anthocyanins on AhR-CYP1A1 signaling, implying zero potential of these compounds for food-drug interactions with respect to AhR-CYP1A1 pathway.|5|2013|Toxicol Lett (Toxicology letters)||Kamenickova, Anzenbacherova, Pavek, Soshilov, Denison, Zapletalova, Anzenbacher, Dvorak.

Recently, TCC has been shown to enhance testosterone-induced effects in vitro and to enlarge accessory sex organs in castrated male rats. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of TCC on intact age-matched male rats and on human prostate LNCaP and C4-2B cells. Seven-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats received either a normal diet or a diet supplemented with TCC (0.25% in diet) for 10 days. Triclocarban induced hyperplasia of accessory sex organs in the absence of significant qualitative histological changes. Serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone were not significantly altered by TCC treatment. In prostate cancer-derived LNCaP and C4-2B cells, TCC potentiated androgen actions via androgen receptor-dependent actions. In conclusion, TCC significantly affects intact male reproductive organs and potentiates androgen effects in prostate cancer cells.|6|2011|Reprod Sci (Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.))||Duleba, Ahmed, Sun, Gao, Villanueva, Conley, Turgeon, Benirschke, Gee, Chen, Green, Lasley.

In this study, we report novel reactive metabolites potentially formed during biotransformation of TCC. The oxidative metabolism of TCC has been predicted using an electrochemical cell coupled online to liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The electrochemical oxidation unveils the fact that hydroxylated metabolites of TCC may form reactive quinone imines. Moreover, a so-far unknown dechlorinated and hydroxylated TCC metabolite has been identified. The results were confirmed by in vitro studies with human and rat liver microsomes. The reactivity of the newly discovered quinone imines was demonstrated by their covalent binding to glutathione and macromolecules, using β-lactoglobulin A as a model protein. The results regarding the capability of the electrochemical cell to mimic the oxidative metabolism of TCC are discussed. Moreover, the occurrence of reactive metabolites is compared with findings from earlier in vivo studies and their relevance in vivo is argued.|Core A|2010|Drug Metab. Dispos.

Endogenous Levels of Five Fatty Acid Metabolites in Exhaled Breath Condensate to Monitor Asthma by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography: Electrospray Tandem Mass Spectrometry|Nording, Malin L.; Yang, Jun; Hegedus, Christine M.; Bhushan, Abhinav; Kenyon, Nicholas J.; Davis, Cristina E.; Hammock, Bruce D.||Airway inflammation characterizing asthma and other airway diseases may be monitored through biomarker analysis of exhaled breath condensate (EBC). In an attempt to discover novel EBC biomarkers, a high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) method was used to analyze EBC from ten control non-asthmatics and one asthmatic individual for five fatty acid metabolites: 9,12,13-trihydroxyoctadecenoic acid (9,12,13-TriHOME), 9,10,13-TriHOME, 12,13-dihydroxyoctadecenoic acid (12,13-DiHOME), 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), and 12(13)-epoxyoctadecenoic acid (12(13)-EpOME). The method was shown to be sensitive, with an on-column limit of quatitation (LOQ) in the pg range (corresponding to pM concentrations in EBC), and linear over several orders of magnitude for each analyte in the calibrated range. Analysis of EBC spiked with the five fatty acid metabolites was within 81%-119% with only a few exceptions. Endogenous levels in EBC exhibited intra- and inter-assay precision of 10%-22%, and 12%-36%, respectively. EBC from the healthy subjects contained average analyte levels between 15 and 180 pM with 12-HETE present above the LOQ in only one of the subjects at a concentration of 240 pM. Exposure of the asthmatic subject to allergen led to increased EBC concentrations of 9,12,13-TriHOME, 9,10,13-TriHOME, 12,13-DiHOME, and 12(13)-EpOME when compared to levels in EBC collected prior to allergen exposure (range =40-510 pM). 12,13-DiHOME was significantly increased (Student's t-test, p < 0.05). In conclusion, we have developed a new HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method for the analysis of five fatty acid metabolites in EBC, which are potential biomarkers for asthma monitoring and diagnosis.|Core A|2010|IEEE Sens J (IEEE sensors journal)||Nording, Yang, Hegedus, Bhushan, Kenyon, Davis, Hammock.

Enhancement of vitamin D metabolites in the eye following vitamin D3 supplementation and UV-B irradiation|Lin, Yanping; Ubels, John L.; Schotanus, Mark P.; Yin, Zhaohong; Pintea, Victorina; Hammock, Bruce D.; Watsky, Mitchell A.|24,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D 3/metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Animals; Aqueous Humor/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects; Calcifediol/metabolism/pharmacokinetics; Cell Line; Epithelium, Corneal/cytology/metabolism/radiation effects; Humans; Limbus Corneae/cytology/metabolism/radiation effects; Miotics/pharmacology; Pilocarpine/pharmacology; Rabbits; Tears/drug effects/metabolism; Ultraviolet Rays; Vitreous Body/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects|PURPOSE: This study was designed to measure vitamin D metabolites in the aqueous and vitreous humor and in tear fluid, and to determine if dietary vitamin D3 supplementation affects these levels. We also determined if the corneal epithelium can synthesize vitamin D following UV-B exposure. METHODS: Rabbits were fed a control or vitamin D3 supplemented diet. Pilocarpine-stimulated tear fluid was collected and aqueous and vitreous humor were drawn from enucleated eyes. Plasma vitamin D was also measured. To test for epithelial vitamin D synthesis, a human corneal limbal epithelial cell line was irradiated with two doses of UV-B (10 and 20 mJ/cm(2)/day for 3 days) and vitamin D was measured in control or 7-dehydrocholesterol treated culture medium. Measurements were made using mass spectroscopy. RESULTS: 25(OH)-vitamin D3 and 24,25(OH)(2)-vitamin D3 increased significantly following D3 supplementation in all samples except vitreous humor. Tear fluid and aqueous humor had small but detectable 1,25(OH)(2)-vitamin D3 levels. Vitamin D2 metabolites were observed in all samples. Vitamin D3 levels were below the detection limit for all samples. Minimal vitamin D3 metabolites were observed in control and UV-B-irradiated epithelial culture medium except following 7-dehydrocholesterol treatment, which resulted in a UV-B-dose dependent increase in vitamin D3, 25(OH)-vitamin D3 and 24,25(OH)(2)-vitamin D3. CONCLUSIONS: There are measurable concentrations of vitamin D metabolites in tear fluid and aqueous and vitreous humor, and oral vitamin D supplementation affects vitamin D metabolite concentrations in the anterior segment of the eye. In addition, the UV exposure results lead us to conclude that corneal epithelial cells are likely capable of synthesizing vitamin D3 metabolites in the presence of 7-dehydrocholesterol following UV-B exposure.|Core A|2012|Curr.

Enhancing the response of CALUX and CAFLUX cell bioassays for quantitative detection of dioxin-like compounds|Zhao, Bin; Baston, David S.; Khan, Elaine; Sorrentino, Claudio; Denison, Michael S.||Reporter genes produce a protein product in transfected cells that can be easily measured in intact or lysed cells and they have been extensively used in numerous basic and applied research applications. Over the past 10 years, reporter gene assays have been widely accepted and used for analysis of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and related dioxin-like compounds in various types of matrices, such as biological, environmental, food and feed samples, given that high-resolution instrumental analysis techniques are impractical for large-scale screening analysis. The most sensitive cell-based reporter gene bioassay systems developed are the mechanism-based CALUX (Chemically Activated Luciferase Expression) and CAFLUX (Chemically Activated Fluorescent Expression) bioassays, which utilize recombinant cell lines containing stably transfected dioxin (AhR)-responsive firefly luciferase or enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter genes, respectively. While the current CALUX and CAFLUX bioassays are very sensitive, increasing their lower limit of sensitivity, magnitude of response and dynamic range for chemical detection would significantly increase their utility, particularly for those samples that contain low levels of dioxin-like HAHs (i.e., serum). In this study, we report that the addition of modulators of cell signaling pathways or modification of cell culture conditions results in significant improvement in the magnitude and overall responsiveness of the existing CALUX and CAFLUX cell bioassays.|5|2010|Sci China Chem (Science China.

Epoxy Fatty Acids and Inhibition of the Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Selectively Modulate GABA Mediated Neurotransmission to Delay Onset of Seizures|Inceoglu, Bora; Zolkowska, Dorota; Yoo, Hyun Ju; Wagner, Karen; Yang, Jun; Hackett, Edward; Hwang, Sung Hee; Lee, Kin Sing Stephen; Rogawski, Michael A.; Morisseau, Christophe; Hammock, Bruce D.||In the brain, seizures lead to release of large amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids including arachidonic acid (ARA). ARA is a substrate for three major enzymatic routes of metabolism by cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450 enzymes. These enzymes convert ARA to potent lipid mediators including prostanoids, leukotrienes and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). The prostanoids and leukotrienes are largely pro-inflammatory molecules that sensitize neurons whereas EETs are anti-inflammatory and reduce the excitability of neurons. Recent evidence suggests a GABA-related mode of action potentially mediated by neurosteroids. Here we tested this hypothesis using models of chemically induced seizures. The level of EETs in the brain was modulated by inhibiting the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), the major enzyme that metabolizes EETs to inactive molecules, by genetic deletion of sEH and by direct administration of EETs into the brain. All three approaches delayed onset of seizures instigated by GABA antagonists but not seizures through other mechanisms. Inhibition of neurosteroid synthesis by finasteride partially blocked the anticonvulsant effects of sEH inhibitors while the efficacy of an inactive dose of neurosteroid allopregnanolone was enhanced by sEH inhibition. Consistent with earlier findings, levels of prostanoids in the brain were elevated. In contrast, levels of bioactive EpFAs were decreased following seizures. Overall these results demonstrate that EETs are natural molecules which suppress the tonic component of seizure related excitability through modulating the GABA activity and that exploration of the EET mediated signaling in the brain could yield alternative approaches to treat convulsive disorders.|5|2013|PLoS ONE (PloS one)||Inceoglu, Zolkowska, Yoo, Wagner, Yang, Hackett, Hwang, Lee, Rogawski, Morisseau, Hammock.

Despite pleiotropic effects on cells, the role of these epoxyeicosanoids in normal organ and tissue regeneration remains unknown. EETs are produced predominantly in the endothelium. Normal organ and tissue regeneration require an active paracrine role of the microvascular endothelium, which in turn depends on angiogenic growth factors. Thus, we hypothesize that endothelial cells stimulate organ and tissue regeneration via production of bioactive EETs. To determine whether endothelial-derived EETs affect physiologic tissue growth in vivo, we used genetic and pharmacological tools to manipulate endogenous EET levels. We show that endothelial-derived EETs play a critical role in accelerating tissue growth in vivo, including liver regeneration, kidney compensatory growth, lung compensatory growth, wound healing, corneal neovascularization, and retinal vascularization. Administration of synthetic EETs recapitulated these results, whereas lowering EET levels, either genetically or pharmacologically, delayed tissue regeneration, demonstrating that pharmacological modulation of EETs can affect normal organ and tissue growth. We also show that soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors, which elevate endogenous EET levels, promote liver and lung regeneration. Thus, our observations indicate a central role for EETs in organ and tissue regeneration and their contribution to tissue homeostasis.|Core A|2013|Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.

They are lipid mediators that act as autocrine or paracrine factors to regulate inflammation and vascular tone. As a result, drugs that raise EET levels are in clinical trials for the treatment of hypertension and many other diseases. However, despite their pleiotropic effects on cells, little is known about the role of these epoxyeicosanoids in cancer. Here, using genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endogenous EET levels, we demonstrate that EETs are critical for primary tumor growth and metastasis in a variety of mouse models of cancer. Remarkably, we found that EETs stimulated extensive multiorgan metastasis and escape from tumor dormancy in several tumor models. This systemic metastasis was not caused by excessive primary tumor growth but depended on endothelium-derived EETs at the site of metastasis. Administration of synthetic EETs recapitulated these results, while EET antagonists suppressed tumor growth and metastasis, demonstrating in vivo that pharmacological modulation of EETs can affect cancer growth. Furthermore, inhibitors of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), the enzyme that metabolizes EETs, elevated endogenous EET levels and promoted primary tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, our data indicate a central role for EETs in tumorigenesis, offering a mechanistic link between lipid signaling and cancer and emphasizing the critical importance of considering possible effects of EET-modulating drugs on cancer.|Core A|2012|J.

Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids enhance axonal growth in primary sensory and cortical neuronal cell cultures|Abdu, Emun; Bruun, Donald A.; Yang, Dongren; Yang, Jun; Inceoglu, Bora; Hammock, Bruce D.; Alkayed, Nabil J.; Lein, Pamela J.|Animals; Axons/physiology; Cell Count; Cell Survival/drug effects; Cells, Cultured; Cerebral Cortex/cytology/drug effects/physiology; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Eicosanoic Acids/pharmacology; Epoxide Hydrolases/metabolism; Female; Ganglia, Spinal/cytology/drug effects; Immunohistochemistry; Neurons/drug effects; Pregnancy; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sensory Receptor Cells/drug effects/physiology; Subcellular Fractions/metabolism; Sympathetic Nervous System/cytology/drug effects|It has recently been reported that soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), the major enzyme that metabolizes epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), is expressed in axons of cortical neurons; however, the functional relevance of axonal sEH localization is unknown. Immunocytochemical analyses demonstrate predominant axonal localization of sEH in primary cultures of not only cortical but also sympathetic and sensory neurons. Morphometric analyses of cultured sensory neurons indicate that exposure to a regioisomeric mixture of EETs (0.01-1.0 μM) causes a concentration-dependent increase in axon outgrowth. This axon promoting activity is not a generalized property of all regioisomers of EETs as axonal growth is enhanced in sensory neurons exposed to 14,15-EET but not 8,9- or 11,12-EET. 14,15-EET also promotes axon outgrowth in cultured cortical neurons. Co-exposure to EETs and either of two structurally diverse pharmacological inhibitors of sEH potentiates the axon-enhancing activity of EETs in sensory and cortical neurons. Mass spectrometry indicates that sEH inhibition significantly increases EETs and significantly decreases dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid metabolites in neuronal cell cultures. These data indicate that EETs enhance axon outgrowth and suggest that axonal sEH activity regulates EETs-induced axon outgrowth. These findings suggest a novel therapeutic use of sEH inhibitors in promoting nerve regeneration.|Core A|2011|J. Neurochem.

Treatment of mushrooms with UV light increases ergocalciferol content and could provide a dietary source of vitamin D. We evaluated the impact of consuming UV-treated white button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) on the vitamin D status of healthy adults. Thirty-eight volunteers were randomized to 4 treatments consumed with a standard meal for 6 wk: the control (C) group received untreated mushrooms providing 0.85 μg/d ergocalciferol (n = 10); groups M1 and M2 received UV-treated mushrooms providing 8.8 (n = 10) and 17.1 μg/d (n = 9), respectively; and the supplement (S) group received purified ergocalciferol plus untreated mushrooms, providing a total of 28.2 μg/d (n = 9). Serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and 25-hydroxyergocalciferol [25(OH)D2] were 83 ± 38 and 2.4 ± 2.0 nmol/L, respectively, at baseline (mean ± SD). At wk 6, 25(OH)D2 had increased and was higher in all treatment groups than in the C group, whereas 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D3] had decreased and was lower in the M2 and S groups than in the C group. Increases in 25(OH)D2 for groups C, M1, M2, and S were 1.2 ± 5.2, 13.8 ± 7.3, 12.7 ± 3.7, and 32.8 ± 3.3 nmol/L and decreases in 25(OH)D3 were -3.9 ± 16.3, -10.4 ± 6.4, -20.6 ± 14.6, and -29.5 ± 15.9 nmol/L, respectively. Concentrations did not change in group C.

Although the overall mechanism of action of the AhR has been extensively studied and involves a classical nuclear receptor mechanism of action (i.e., ligand-dependent nuclear localization, protein heterodimerization, binding of liganded receptor as a protein complex to its specific DNA recognition sequence and activation of gene expression), details of the exact molecular events that result in most AhR-dependent biochemical, physiological, and toxicological effects are generally lacking. Ongoing research efforts continue to describe an ever-expanding list of ligand-, species-, and tissue-specific spectrum of AhR-dependent biological and toxicological effects that seemingly add even more complexity to the mechanism. However, at the same time, these studies are also identifying and characterizing new pathways and molecular mechanisms by which the AhR exerts its actions and plays key modulatory roles in both endogenous developmental and physiological pathways and response to exogenous chemicals. Here we provide an overview of the classical and nonclassical mechanisms that can contribute to the differential sensitivity and diversity in responses observed in humans and other species following ligand-dependent activation of the AhR signal transduction pathway.|5|2011|Toxicol.

Factors Contributing to the Off-Target Transport of Pyrethroid Insecticides from Urban Surfaces|Jorgenson, Brant C.; Wissel-Tyson, Christopher; Young, Thomas M.||Pyrethroid insecticides used in urban and suburban contexts have been found in urban creek sediments and associated with toxicity in aquatic bioassays. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the main factors contributing to the off-target transport of pyrethroid insecticides from surfaces typical of residential landscapes. Controlled rainfall simulations over concrete, bare soil, and turf plots treated individually with pyrethroid insecticides in a suspension concentrate, an emulsifiable concentrate, or a granule formulation were conducted at different rainfall intensities and different product set-time intervals. Pyrethroid mass washoff varied by several orders of magnitude between experimental treatments. Suspension concentrate product application to concrete yielded significantly greater washoff than any other treatment; granule product application to turf yielded the least washoff. Fractional losses at 10 L of runoff ranged from 25.9 to 0.011% of pyrethroid mass applied, and 10 L nominal mass losses ranged from 3970 to 0.18 μg. Mass washoff depended principally on formulation and surface type combination and, to a lesser degree, on set-time interval and rainfall intensity. Treatment effects were analyzed by ANOVA on main factors of formulation, surface type, and set time. Factor effects were not purely additive; a significant interaction between formulation and surface type was noted.|1|2012|J. Agric. Food Chem.

Toxicity depends on metabolic activation, and reactive metabolite binding correlates with tissue and site susceptibility. OBJECTIVES: We compared proteins adducted in nasal epithelium from rats and rhesus macaques in vitro. METHODS: Adducted proteins recovered from incubations of nasal epithelium and 14C-naphthalene were separated by two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and imaged to register radioactive proteins. We identified proteins visualized by silver staining on complementary non-radioactive gels by peptide mass mapping. RESULTS: The levels of reactive metabolite binding in incubations of rhesus ethmo-turbinates and maxillo-turbinates are similar to those in incubations of target tissues, including rat septal/-olfactory regions and murine dissected airway incubations. We identified 40 adducted spots from 2D gel separations of rat olfactory epithelial proteins; 22 of these were non-redundant. In monkeys, we identified 19 spots by mass spectrometry, yielding three non-redundant identifications. Structural proteins (actin/tubulin) were prominent targets in both species. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we identified potential target proteins that may serve as markers closely associated with toxicity. The large differences in previously reported rates of naphthalene metabolism to water-soluble metabolites in dissected airways from mice and monkeys are not reflected in similar differences in covalent adduct formation in the nose.

Formation of hydroxyl radical from San Joaquin Valley particles extracted in a cell-free surrogate lung fluid|Shen, H.; Anastasio, C.||Previous studies have suggested that the adverse health effects from ambient particulate matter (PM) are linked to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by PM in cardiopulmonary tissues. While hydroxyl radical ((•)OH) is the most reactive of the ROS species, there are few quantitative studies of (•)OH generation from PM. Here we report on (•)OH formation from PM collected at an urban (Fresno) and rural (Westside) site in the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) of California. We quantified (•)OH in PM extracts using a cell-free, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution with or without 50μM ascorbate (Asc). The results show that generally the urban Fresno PM generates much more (•)OH than the rural Westside PM. The presence of Asc at a physiologically relevant concentration in the extraction solution greatly enhances (•)OH formation from all the samples. Fine PM (PM(2.5)) generally makes more (•)OH than the corresponding coarse PM (PM(cf), i.e. with diameters of 2.5 to 10 μm) normalized by air volume collected, while the coarse PM typically generates more (•)OH normalized by PM mass. (•)OH production by SJV PM is reduced on average by (97±6)% when the transition metal chelator desferoxamine (DSF) is added to the extraction solution, indicating a dominant role of transition metals. By measuring calibration curves of (•)OH generation from copper and iron, and quantifying copper and iron concentrations in our particle extracts, we find that PBS-soluble copper is primarily responsible for (•)OH production by the SJV PM, while iron often makes a significant contribution. Extrapolating our results to expected burdens of PM-derived (•)OH in human lung lining fluid suggests that typical daily PM exposures in the San Joaquin Valley are unlikely to result in a high amount of pulmonary (•)OH, although high PM events could produce much higher levels of (•)OH, which might lead to cytotoxicity.|7|2011|Atmos Chem Phys (Atmospheric chemistry and physics (Print))||Shen, Anastasio.

Formulation effects and the off-target transport of pyrethroid insecticides from urban hard surfaces|Jorgenson, Brant C.; Young, Thomas M.|Alkanesulfonic Acids/chemistry; Chemistry, Organic/methods; Cities; Computer Simulation; Environmental Monitoring/methods; Insecticides/analysis; Kinetics; Organic Chemicals/analysis; Pesticide Residues/analysis; Pyrethrins/analysis/chemistry; Rain; Surface-Active Agents/chemistry; Water Movements; Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis/chemistry|Controlled rainfall experiments utilizing drop-forming rainfall simulators were conducted to study various factors contributing to off-target transport of off-the-shelf formulated pyrethroid insecticides from concrete surfaces. Factors evaluated included active ingredient, product formulation, time between application and rainfall (set time), and rainfall intensity. As much as 60% and as little as 0.8% of pyrethroid applied could be recovered in surface runoff depending primarily on product formulation, and to a lesser extent on product set time. Resulting wash-off profiles during one-hour storm simulations could be categorized based on formulation, with formulations utilizing emulsifying surfactants rather than organic solvents resulting in unique wash-off profiles with overall higher wash-off efficiency. These higher wash-off efficiency profiles were qualitatively replicated by applying formulation-free neat pyrethroid in the presence of independently applied linear alkyl benzene sulfonate (LAS) surfactant, suggesting that the surfactant component of some formulated products may be influential in pyrethroid wash-off from urban hard surfaces.|1|2010|Environ.

Förster resonance energy transfer competitive displacement assay for human soluble epoxide hydrolase|Lee, Kin Sing Stephen; Morisseau, Christophe; Yang, Jun; Wang, Peng; Hwang, Sung Hee; Hammock, Bruce D.||The soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), responsible for the hydrolysis of various fatty acid epoxides to their corresponding 1,2-diols, is becoming an attractive pharmaceutical target. These fatty acid epoxides, particularly epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), play an important role in human homeostatic and inflammation processes. Therefore, inhibition of human sEH, which stabilizes EETs in vivo, brings several beneficial effects to human health. Although there are several catalytic assays available to determine the potency of sEH inhibitors, measuring the in vitro inhibition constant (K(i)) for these inhibitors using catalytic assay is laborious. In addition, k(off), which has been recently suggested to correlate better with the in vivo potency of inhibitors, has never been measured for sEH inhibitors. To better measure the potency of sEH inhibitors, a reporting ligand, 1-(adamantan-1-yl)-3-(1-(2-(7-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-4-yl)acetyl) piperidin-4-yl)urea (ACPU), was designed and synthesized. With ACPU, we have developed a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based competitive displacement assay using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence from sEH. In addition, the resulting assay allows us to measure the K(i) values of very potent compounds to the picomolar level and to obtain relative k(off) values of the inhibitors. This assay provides additional data to evaluate the potency of sEH inhibitors.|5|2013|Anal. Biochem. (Analytical biochemistry)||Lee, Morisseau, Yang, Wang, Hwang, Hammock. (2013).

However the consequences of frataxin depletion have not been measured in dorsal root ganglia or Schwann cells. We knocked down frataxin in several neural cell lines, including two dorsal root ganglia neural lines, 2 neuronal lines, a human oligodendroglial line (HOG) and multiple Schwann cell lines and measured cell death and proliferation. Only Schwann cells demonstrated a significant decrease in viability. In addition to the death of Schwann cells, frataxin decreased proliferation in Schwann, oligodendroglia, and slightly in one neural cell line. Thus the most severe effects of frataxin deficiency were on Schwann cells, which enwrap dorsal root ganglia neurons. Microarray of frataxin-deficient Schwann cells demonstrated strong activations of inflammatory and cell death genes including interleukin-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor which were confirmed at the mRNA and protein levels. Frataxin knockdown in Schwann cells also specifically induced inflammatory arachidonate metabolites. Anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic drugs significantly rescued frataxin-dependent Schwann cell toxicity. Thus, frataxin deficiency triggers inflammatory changes and death of Schwann cells that is inhibitable by inflammatory and anti-apoptotic drugs.|Core A|2009|Biochim. Biophys.

Free flow electrophoresis separation and AMS quantitation of C-naphthalene-protein adducts|Buchholz, Bruce A.; Haack, Kurt W.; Sporty, Jennifer L.; Buckpitt, Alan R.; Morin, Dexter||Naphthalene is a volatile aromatic hydrocarbon to which humans are exposed from a variety of sources including mobile air sources and cigarette smoke. Naphthalene produces dose- (concentration) dependent injury to airway epithelial cells of murine lung which is observed at concentrations well below the current occupational exposure standard. Toxicity is dependent upon the cytochrome P450 mediated metabolic activation of the parent substrate to unstable metabolites which become bound covalently to tissue proteins. Nearly 70 proteins have been identified as forming adducts with reactive naphthalene metabolites using in vitro systems but very little work has been conducted in vivo because reasonably large amounts (100 μCi) of (14)C labeled parent compound must be administered to generate detectable adduct levels on storage phosphor screens following separation of labeled proteins by 2 D gel electrophoresis. The work described here was done to provide proof of concept that protein separation by free flow electrophoresis followed by AMS detection of protein fractions containing protein bound reactive metabolites would provide adducted protein profiles in animals dosed with trace quantities of labeled naphthalene. Mice were administered 200 mg/kg naphthalene intraperitoneally at a calculated specific activity of 2 DPM/nmol (1 pCi/nmol) and respiratory epithelial tissue was obtained by lysis lavage 4 hr post injection. Free flow electrophoresis (FFE) separates proteins in the liquid phase over a large pH range (2.5-11.5) using low molecular weight acids and bases to modify the pH. The apparatus separates fractions into standard 96-well plates that can be used in other protein analysis techniques. The buffers of the fractions have very high carbon content, however, and need to be dialyzed to yield buffers compatible with (14)C-AMS.

Functional and biochemical properties of ryanodine receptor type 1 channels from heterozygous R163C malignant hyperthermia-susceptible mice|Feng, Wei; Barrientos, Genaro C.; Cherednichenko, Gennady; Yang, Tianzhong; Padilla, Isela T.; Truong, Kim; Allen, Paul D.; Lopez, José R.; Pessah, Isaac N.|Animals; Blotting, Western; Calcium/metabolism; Heterozygote; Malignant Hyperthermia/metabolism/physiopathology; Membrane Potentials/physiology; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Mutant Strains; Muscle Fibers, Skeletal/metabolism/physiology; Muscle, Skeletal/metabolism/physiology; Oxidation-Reduction; Protein Phosphatase 1/metabolism; Ryanodine/metabolism; Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel/genetics/metabolism/physiology; Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases/metabolism|Mutations in ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) confer malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. How inherent impairments in Ca(2+) channel regulation affect skeletal muscle function in myotubes and adult fibers under basal (nontriggering) conditions are not understood. Myotubes, adult flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) fibers, and sarcoplasmic reticulum skeletal membranes were isolated from heterozygous knockin R163C and wild-type (WT) mice. Compared with WT myotubules, R163C myotubes have reduced Ca(2+) transient amplitudes in response to electrical field pulses; however, R163C FDB fibers do not differ in their responses to electrical stimuli, despite heightened cellular cytoplasmic resting Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](rest)) and sensitivity to halothane. Immunoblotting of membranes from each genotype shows similar expression of RyR1, FK506 binding protein 12 kDa, and Ca(2+)-ATPase, but RyR1 (2844)Ser phosphorylation in R163C muscle is 31% higher than that of WT muscle (p < 0.001). RyR1 channels reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers reveal ∼65% of R163C channels exhibit ≥2-fold greater open probability (P(o)) than WT, with prolonged mean open dwell times and shortened closed dwell times. [(3)H]Ryanodine (Ry) binding and single-channel analyses show that R163C-RyR1 has altered regulation compared with WT: 1) 3-fold higher sensitivity to Ca(2+) activation; 2) 2-fold greater [(3)H]Ry receptor occupancy; 3) comparatively higher channel activity, even in reducing glutathione buffer; 4) enhanced RyR1 activity both at 25 and 37°C; and 5) elevated cytoplasmic [Ca(2+)](rest). R163C channels are inherently more active than WT channels, a functional impairment that cannot be reversed by dephosphorylation with protein phosphatase. Dysregulated R163C channels produce a more overt phenotype in myotubes than in adult fibers in the absence of triggering agents, suggesting tighter negative regulation of R163C-RyR1 within the Ca(2+) release unit of adult fibers.|5|2011|Mol.

Gas-phase flame synthesis and properties of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with reduced oxidation state|Kumfer, Benjamin M.; Shinoda, Kozo; Jeyadevan, Balachandran; Kennedy, Ian M.||Iron oxide nanoparticles of reduced oxidation state, mainly in the form of magnetite, have been synthesized utilizing a new continuous, gas-phase, nonpremixed flame method using hydrocarbon fuels. This method takes advantage of the characteristics of the inverse flame, which is produced by injection of oxidizer into a surrounding flow of fuel. Unlike traditional flame methods, this configuration allows for the iron particle formation to be maintained in a more reducing environment. The effects of flame temperature, oxygen-enrichment and fuel dilution (i.e. the stoichiometric mixture fraction), and fuel composition on particle size, Fe oxidation state, and magnetic properties are evaluated and discussed. The crystallite size, Fe(II) fraction, and saturation magnetization were all found to increase with flame temperature. Flames of methane and ethylene were used, and the use of ethylene resulted in particles containing metallic Fe(0), in addition to magnetite, while no Fe(0) was present in samples synthesized using methane.|7|2010|J Aerosol Sci (Journal of aerosol science)||Kumfer, Shinoda, Jeyadevan, Kennedy.

This approach is illustrated with the two commonly encountered transition metals, copper and iron. First, their abilities to generate hydroxyl radical were measured in a cell-free, phosphate-buffered saline solution containing ascorbate and/or citrate. Second, their abilities to induce heme oxygenase-1 in cultured human epidermal keratinocytes were assessed in cell culture. Combustion-generated copper oxide nanoparticles were active in both assays and were found to be soluble in culture medium. Depletion of glutathione in the cells or loading the cells with ascorbate greatly increased heme oxygenase-1 induction in the presence of copper. By contrast, iron oxide nanoparticles were active in the phosphate-buffered saline but not in cell culture, and they aggregated in culture medium. Soluble salts of copper and iron exhibited the same contrast in activities as the respective combustion-generated particles. The results suggest that the capability of combustion-generated environmental samples to produce oxidant stress can be screened effectively in a two step process, first in phosphate-buffered saline with ascorbate and subsequently in epithelial cell culture for those exhibiting activity initially. The results also point to an unanticipated interaction in cells of oxidant stress-generating metals with an antioxidant (ascorbate) that is usually missing in culture medium formulations. Thus, ascorbate supplementation of cultured human cells is likely to improve their ability to model the in vivo effects of particulate matter containing copper and other redox-active metals.|5|2009|Chem.

Ginsenosides are novel naturally-occurring aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands|Hu, Qin; He, Guochun; Zhao, Jing; Soshilov, Anatoly; Denison, Michael S.; Zhang, Aiqian; Yin, Huijun; Fraccalvieri, Domenico; Bonati, Laura; Xie, Qunhui; Zhao, Bin||The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that mediates many of the biological and toxicological actions of structurally diverse chemicals. In this study, we examined the ability of a series of ginsenosides extracted from ginseng, a traditional Chinese medicine, to bind to and activate/inhibit the AHR and AHR signal transduction. Utilizing a combination of ligand and DNA binding assays, molecular docking and reporter gene analysis, we demonstrated the ability of selected ginsenosides to directly bind to and activate the guinea pig cytosolic AHR, and to stimulate/inhibit AHR-dependent luciferase gene expression in a recombinant guinea pig cell line. Comparative studies revealed significant species differences in the ability of ginsenosides to stimulate AHR-dependent gene expression in guinea pig, rat, mouse and human cell lines. Not only did selected ginsenosides preferentially activate the AHR from one species and not others, mouse cell line was also significantly less responsive to these chemicals than rat and guinea pig cell lines, but the endogenous gene CYP1A1 could still be inducted in mouse cell line. Overall, the ability of these compounds to stimulate AHR signal transduction demonstrated that these ginsenosides are a new class of naturally occurring AHR agonists.|5|2013|PLoS ONE (PloS one)||Hu, He, Zhao, Soshilov, Denison, Zhang, Yin, Fraccalvieri, Bonati, Xie, Zhao.

PTMs, particularly glycosylation, can greatly influence protein structure, function, and stability and can particularly influence the gut where their degradation products are potentially bioactive. In this work, previously undiscovered temporal variations in both expression and glycosylation of the glycoproteome of human milk are observed. Lactoferrin, one of the most abundant glycoproteins in human milk, is shown to be dynamically glycosylated during the first 10 days of lactation.

Green tea catechins are potent sensitizers of ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1)|Feng, Wei; Cherednichenko, Gennady; Ward, Chris W.; Padilla, Isela T.; Cabrales, Elaine; Lopez, José R.; Eltit, José M.; Allen, Paul D.; Pessah, Isaac N.|Action Potentials; Adult; Anticarcinogenic Agents; Antioxidants/pharmacology; Apoptosis/drug effects; Catechin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology; Humans; Neurons/drug effects/physiology; Plant Extracts/chemistry; Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel/drug effects/metabolism; Sarcoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects/physiology; Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology; Structure-Activity Relationship; Synaptic Transmission/drug effects; Tea/chemistry|Catechins, polyphenols extracted from green tea leaves, have a broad range of biological activities although the specific molecular mechanisms responsible are not known. At the high experimental concentrations typically used polyphenols bind to membrane phospholipid and also are easily auto-oxidized to generate superoxide anion and semiquinones, and can adduct to protein thiols. We report that the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is a molecular target that responds to nanomolar (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG). Single channel analyses demonstrate EGCG (5-10nM) increases channel open probability (Po) twofold, by lengthening open dwell time. The degree of channel activation is concentration-dependent and is rapidly and fully reversible. Four related catechins, EGCG, ECG, EGC ((-)-epigallocatechin) and EC ((-)-epicatechin) showed a rank order of activity toward RyR1 (EGCG>ECG>EGC>EC). EGCG and ECG enhance the sensitivity of RyR1 to activation by < or =100microM cytoplasmic Ca(2+) without altering inhibitory potency by >100microM Ca(2+). EGCG as high as 10microM in the extracellular medium potentiated Ca(2+) transient amplitudes evoked by electrical stimuli applied to intact myotubes and adult FDB fibers, without eliciting spontaneous Ca(2+) release or slowing Ca(2+) transient recovery. The results identify RyR1 as a sensitive target for the major tea catechins EGCG and ECG, and this interaction is likely to contribute to their observed biological activities.|5|2010|Biochem.

Growth hormone enhances arachidonic acid metabolites in a growth hormone transgenic mouse|Oberbauer, A. M.; German, J. B.; Murray, J.

Using this model, the effects of low, moderate, and high chronic GH on fatty acid composition were determined for adipose and hepatic tissue and the metabolites of 20:4n-6 (arachidonic acid) were characterized to identify metabolic targets of action of elevated GH. The products of Δ-9 desaturase in hepatic, but not adipose, tissue were reduced in response to elevated GH. Proportional to the level of circulating GH, the products of Δ-5 and Δ-6 were increased in both adipose and hepatic tissue for the omega-6 lipids (e.g., 20:4n-6), while only the hepatic tissues showed an increase for omega-3 lipids (e.g., 22:6n-3). The eicosanoids, PGE₂ and 12-HETE, were elevated with high GH but circulating thromboxane was not. Hepatic PTGS1 and 2 (COX1 and COX 2), SOD1, and FADS2 (Δ-6 desaturase) mRNAs were increased with elevated GH while FAS mRNA was reduced; SCD1 (stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase) and SCD2 mRNA did not significantly differ. The present study showed that GH influences the net flux through various aspects of lipid metabolism and especially the desaturase metabolic processes. The combination of altered metabolism and tissue specificity suggest that the regulation of membrane composition and its effects on signaling pathways, including the production and actions of eicosanoids, can be mediated by the GH regulatory axis.|Core A|2011|Lipids (Lipids)||Oberbauer, German, Murray.

Humic acids buffer the effects of urea on soil ammonia oxidizers and potential nitrification|Dong, L.; Cordova-Kreylos, A. L.; Yang, J.; Yuan, H.; Scow, K. M.||Humic acids (HAs) play an important role in the global nitrogen cycle by influencing the distribution, bioavailability, and ultimate fate of organic nitrogen. Ammonium oxidation by autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) is a key process in ecosystems and is limited, in part, by the availability of [Formula: see text]. We evaluated the impact of HAs on soil AOB in microcosms by applying urea (1.0%, equal to 10 mg urea/g soil) with 0.1% bHA (biodegraded lignite humic acids, equal to 1 mg/g soil), 0.1% cHA (crude lignite humic acids) or no amendment. AOB population size, ammonium and nitrate concentrations were monitored for 12 weeks after urea and HA application. AOB densities (quantified by real-time PCR targeting the amoA) in the Urea treatments increased about ten-fold (the final abundance: 5.02 x 10(7) copies (g of dry soil)(-1)) after one week of incubation and decreased to the initial density after 12 weeks incubation; the population size of total bacteria (quantified by real-time PCR with a universal bacterial probe) decreased from 1.12 x 10(10) to 2.59 x 10(9) copies (g of dry soil)(-1) at week one and fluctuated back to the initial copy number at week 12. In the Urea + bHA and Urea + cHA treatments, the AOB densities were 4 and 6 times higher, respectively, than the initial density of approximately 5.07 x 10(6) copies (g of dry soil)(-1) at week 1 and did not change much up to week 4; the total bacteria density changed little over time. The AOB and total bacteria density of the controls changed little during the 12 weeks of incubation. The microbial community composition of the Urea treatment, based on T-RFLP using CCA (canonical correspondence analysis) and pCCA (partial CCA) analysis, was clearly different from those of other treatments, and suggested that lignite HAs buffered the change in diversity and quantity of total bacteria caused by the application of urea to the soil. We hypothesize that HAs can inhibit the change in microbial community composition and numbers, as well as AOB population size by reducing the hydrolysis rate from urea to ammonium in soils amended with urea.|1|2009|Soil biology & biochemistry (Soil Biol Biochem)||Dong, Cordova-Kreylos, Yang, Yuan, Scow.

Oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization between 3 and 14 were separated from simple monosaccharides and disaccharides by solid-phase extraction. The concentrations of free oligosaccharides were over 100 mg/L in both red and white wines. The free oligosaccharides-characterized for the first time in the present study-include hexose-oligosaccharides, xyloglucans, and arabinogalactans and may be the natural byproduct of the degradation of cell wall polysaccharides.

Identification of 13-hydroxy-14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid as an acid-stable endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor in rabbit arteries|Chawengsub, Yuttana; Gauthier, Kathryn M.; Nithipatikom, Kasem; Hammock, Bruce D.; Falck, John R.; Narsimhaswamy, Dubasi; Campbell, William B.|8,11,14-Eicosatrienoic Acid/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism; Acids/pharmacology; Animals; Arachidonic Acid/metabolism; Arteries/chemistry/cytology/drug effects/metabolism; Endothelium, Vascular/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism; Rabbits; Vasodilator Agents/chemistry/metabolism|Arachidonic acid (AA) is metabolized by endothelial 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) to several vasodilatory eicosanoids such as 11,12,15-trihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (11,12,15-THETA) and its proposed unstable precursor 15-hydroxy-11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (15-H-11,12-EETA). In the present study, the acid-stable 13-hydroxy-trans-14,15-epoxy-eicosatrienoic acid (13-H-14,15-EETA) was identified and its vascular activities characterized. Rabbit aorta, mesenteric arteries, and the combination of 15-LO and cytochrome P450 2J2 converted AA to two distinct HEETA metabolites. The HEETA metabolites were resistant to acidic hydrolysis but were hydrolyzed by recombinant sEH to a more polar metabolite identified by mass spectrometry as 13,14,15-THETA. Mass spectrometric analyses and HPLC comigration identified the HEETAs as threo- and erythro-diastereomers of 13-H-trans-14,15-EETA. Erythro- and threo-diastereomers of 13-H-trans-14,15-EETA relaxed endothelium-denuded rabbit small mesenteric arteries with maximum relaxations of 22.6 +/- 6.0% and 8.6 +/- 4.3%, respectively. Apamin (10(-7) m) inhibited the relaxations to the erythro-isomer (maximum relaxation = 1.2 +/- 5.6%) and increasing [K(+)](o) from 4.6 to 30 mm blocked relaxations to both isomers. In cell-attached patches of mesenteric arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs), erythro-13-H-trans-14,15-EETA (1-3 x 10(-6) m) increased mean open time of small conductance K(+) channels (13-14 pS) from 0.0007 +/- 0.0007 to 0.0053 +/- 0.0042. This activation was inhibited by apamin. The erythro, but not the threo, isomer blocked angiotensin II-stimulated aortic SMC migration. These studies demonstrate that 13-H-14,15-EETAs induces vascular relaxation via K(+) channel activation to cause SMC hyperpolarization. Thus, 13-H-14,15-EETA represents a new endothelial factor.|Core A|2009|J. Biol. Chem.

The ability of these leachates to induce Ah receptor (AhR)-dependent cytochrome P4501A1 expression in fish indicated the presence of AhR active chemicals, but the responsible chemicals and their direct interaction with the AhR signaling pathway were not examined. Using a combination of AhR-based bioassays, we have demonstrated the ability of tire extract to stimulate both AhR DNA binding and AhR-dependent gene expression and confirmed that the responsible chemicals were metabolically labile. The application of CALUX (chemical-activated luciferase gene expression) cell bioassay-driven toxicant identification evaluation not only revealed that tire extract contained a variety of known AhR-active polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons but also identified 2-methylthiobenzothiazole and 2-mercaptobenzothiazole as AhR agonists. Analysis of a structurally diverse series of benzothiazoles identified many that could directly stimulate AhR DNA binding and transiently activate the AhR signaling pathway and identified benzothiazoles as a new class of AhR agonists. In addition to these compounds, the relatively high AhR agonist activity of a large number of fractions strongly suggests that tire extract contains a large number of physiochemically diverse AhR agonists whose identities and toxicological/biological significances are unknown.|5|2011|Environ.

The pyrethroid assays are used to illustrate the use of some of these immunoreagents such as antibodies, competitive mimics, and novel binding agents such as phage-displayed peptides. The paper also illustrates reporters such as fluorescent dyes, chemiluminescent compounds, and luminescent lanthanide nanoparticles, as well as the application of magnetic separation, and automatic instrumental systems, biosensors, and novel immunological technologies.

Short sample preparation time and sensitive, economical high-throughput assays are needed for biomonitoring studies that analyze a large number of samples. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used for determining 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a general urinary biomarker of exposure to some pyrethroid insecticides. A mixed-mode solid-phase extraction reduced interferences from acid hydrolyzed urine and gave 110 ± 6% recoveries from spiked samples. The method limit of quantification was 2 μg/L. Urine samples were collected from forestry workers that harvest pine cone seeds where pyrethroid insecticides were applied at ten different orchards. At least four samples for each worker were collected in a 1-week period. The 3-PBA in workers classified as high, low, or no exposure based on job analysis over all sampling days was 6.40 ± 9.60 (n = 200), 5.27 ± 5.39 (n = 52), and 3.56 ± 2.64 ng/mL (n = 34), respectively. Pair-wise comparison of the differences in least squares means of 3-PBA concentrations among groups only showed a significant difference between high and no exposure. Although this difference was not significant when 3-PBA excretion was normalized by creatinine excretion, the general trend was still apparent. No significant differences were observed among days or orchards. This ELISA method using a 96-well plate was performed as a high-throughput tool for analyzing around 300 urine samples measured in triplicate to provide data for workers exposure assessment.|3|2011|Anal Bioanal Chem (Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry)||Ahn, Gee, Kim, Aronov, Vega, Krieger, Hammock.

Impacts of Antioxidants on Hydroxyl Radical Production from Individual and Mixed Transition Metals in a Surrogate Lung Fluid|Charrier, Jessica G.; Anastasio, Cort||Inhalation of ambient particulate matter causes morbidity and mortality in humans. One hypothesized mechanism of toxicity is the particle-induced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) - including the highly damaging hydroxyl radical ((·)OH) - followed by inflammation and a variety of diseases. While past studies have found correlations between ROS formation and a variety of metals, there are no quantitative measurements of (·)OH formation from transition metals at concentrations relevant to 24-hour ambient particulate exposure. This research reports specific and quantitative measurements of (·)OH formation from 10 individual transition metals (and several mixtures) in a cell-free surrogate lung fluid (SLF) with four antioxidants: ascorbate, citrate, glutathione, and uric acid. We find that Fe and Cu can produce (·)OH under all antioxidant conditions as long as ascorbate is present and that mixtures of the two metals synergistically increase (·)OH production. Manganese and vanadium can also produce (·)OH under some conditions, but given that their ambient levels are typically very low, these metals are not likely to chemically produce significant levels of (·)OH in the lung fluid. Cobalt, chromium, nickel, zinc, lead, and cadmium do not produce (·)OH under any of our experimental conditions. The antioxidant composition of our SLF significantly affects (·)OH production from Fe and Cu: ascorbate is required for (·)OH formation, citrate increases (·)OH production from Fe, and both citrate and glutathione suppress (·)OH production from Cu. MINTEQ ligand speciation modeling indicates that citrate and glutathione affect (·)OH production by changing metal speciation, altering the reactivity of the metals. In the most realistic SLF (i.e., with all four antioxidants), Fe generates approximately six times more (·)OH than does the equivalent amount of Cu. Since levels of soluble Fe in PM are typically higher than those of Cu, our results suggest that Fe dominates the chemical generation of (·)OH from deposited particles in the lungs.|7|2011|Atmos Environ (Atmospheric environment (Oxford, England : 1994))||Charrier, Anastasio.

Impacts of different N management regimes on nitrifier and denitrifier communities and N cycling in soil microenvironments|Kong, Angela Y Y; Hristova, Krassimira; Scow, Kate M.; Six, Johan||Real-time quantitative PCR assays, targeting part of the ammonia-monooxygenase (amoA), nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ), and 16S rRNA genes were coupled with (15)N pool dilution techniques to investigate the effects of long-term agricultural management practices on potential gross N mineralization and nitrification rates, as well as ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), denitrifier, and total bacterial community sizes within different soil microenvironments. Three soil microenvironments [coarse particulate organic matter (cPOM; >250 μm), microaggregate (53-250 μm), and silt-and-clay fraction (<53 μm)] were physically isolated from soil samples collected across the cropping season from conventional, low-input, and organic maize-tomato systems (Zea mays L.- Lycopersicum esculentum L.). We hypothesized that (i) the higher N inputs and soil N content of the organic system foster larger AOB and denitrifier communities than in the conventional and low-input systems, (ii) differences in potential gross N mineralization and nitrification rates across the systems correspond with AOB and denitrifier abundances, and (iii) amoA, nosZ, and 16S rRNA gene abundances are higher in the microaggregates than in the cPOM and silt-and-clay microenvironments. Despite 13 years of different soil management and greater soil C and N content in the organic compared to the conventional and low-input systems, total bacterial communities within the whole soil were similar in size across the three systems (~5.15×10(8) copies g(-1) soil). However, amoA gene densities were ~2 times higher in the organic (1.75×10(8) copies g(-1) soil) than the other systems at the start of the season and nosZ gene abundances were ~2 times greater in the conventional (7.65×10(7) copies g(-1) soil) than in the other systems by the end of the season. Because organic management did not consistently lead to larger AOB and denitrifier communities than the other two systems, our first hypothesis was not corroborated. Our second hypothesis was also not corroborated because canonical correspondence analyses revealed that AOB and denitrifier abundances were decoupled from potential gross N mineralization and nitrification rates and from inorganic N concentrations. Our third hypothesis was supported by the overall larger nitrifier, denitrifier, and total bacterial communities measured in the soil microaggregates compared to the cPOM and silt-and-clay.

In Situ Biotreatment of TBA with Recirculation/Oxygenation|North, K. P.; Mackay, D. M.; Kayne, J. S.; Petersen, D.; Rasa, E.; Rastegarzadeh, L.; Holland, R. B.; Scow, K. M.||The potential for in situ biodegradation of tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) by creation of aerobic conditions in the subsurface with recirculating well pairs was investigated in two field studies conducted at Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB). In the first experiment, a single recirculating well pair with bromide tracer and oxygen amendment successfully delivered oxygen to the subsurface for 42 days. TBA concentrations were reduced from approximately 500 mug/L to below the detection limit within the treatment zone and the treated water was detected in a monitoring transect several meters downgradient. In the second experiment, a site-calibrated model was used to design a double recirculating well pair with oxygen amendment, which successfully delivered oxygen to the subsurface for 291 days and also decreased TBA concentrations to below the detection limit. Methylibium petroleiphilum strain PM1, a known TBA-degrading bacterium, was detectable at the study site but addition of oxygen had little impact on the already low baseline population densities, suggesting that there was not enough carbon within the groundwater plume to support significant new growth in the PM1 population. Given favorable hydrogeologic and geochemical conditions, the use of recirculating well pairs to introduce dissolved oxygen into the subsurface is a viable method to stimulate in situ biodegradation of TBA or other aerobically-degradable aquifer contaminants.|1|2012|Ground water monitoring & remediation (Ground Water Monit Remediat)||North, Mackay, Kayne, Petersen, Rasa, Rastegarzadeh, Holland, Scow.

Increase of EPA-derived hydroxy, epoxy and dihydroxy fatty acid levels in human plasma after a single dose of long-chain omega-3 PUFA|Schuchardt, Jan Philipp; Schneider, Inga; Willenberg, Ina; Yang, Jun; Hammock, Bruce D.; Hahn, Andreas; Schebb, Nils Helge||INTRODUCTION: Several supplementation studies with long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA) describe an increase of EPA-derived hydroxy, epoxy and dihydroxy fatty acids in blood, while changes in levels of other LC n-3 and n-6 PUFA-derived oxylipins were minor. In order to investigate the kinetics of changes in oxylipin levels in response to LC n-3 PUFA ingestion, we conducted a single dose treatment study with healthy subjects. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In the present kinetic study, we compared patterns of hydroxy, epoxy and dihydroxy fatty acids in plasma of 6 healthy men before and after 6, 8, 24, and 48h of fish oil (1008mg EPA and 672mg DHA) ingestion. Levels of EPA- as well as other LC PUFA-derived hydroxy, epoxy and dihydroxy fatty acids were analyzed in plasma by LC-MS. Additionally, levels of these oxylipins were compared with their parent PUFA levels in plasma phospholipids. RESULTS: All EPA-derived oxylipin levels were significantly increased 6h after LC n-3 PUFA ingestion and gradually drop thereafter reaching the baseline levels about 48h after treatment. The relative increase in EPA plasma phospholipid levels highly correlated with the increase of plasma EPA-derived oxylipin levels at different time points. In contrast, plasma levels of arachidonic acid- and DHA-derived oxylipins as well as parent PUFA levels in plasma phospholipids were hardly changed. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that a single dose of LC n-3 PUFAs can rapidly induce a shift in the EPA oxylipin profile of healthy subjects within a few hours. Taking the high biological activity of the EPA-derived epoxy fatty acids into account, even short-term treatment with LC n-3 PUFAs may cause systemic effects, which warrant further investigation.|Core A|2014|Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat.

Individual variation in lipidomic profiles of healthy subjects in response to omega-3 Fatty acids|Nording, Malin L.; Yang, Jun; Georgi, Katrin; Hegedus Karbowski, Christine; German, J. Bruce; Weiss, Robert H.; Hogg, Ronald J.; Trygg, Johan; Hammock, Bruce D.; Zivkovic, Angela M.||INTRODUCTION: Conflicting findings in both interventional and observational studies have resulted in a lack of consensus on the benefits of ω3 fatty acids in reducing disease risk. This may be due to individual variability in response. We used a multi-platform lipidomic approach to investigate both the consistent and inconsistent responses of individuals comprehensively to a defined ω3 intervention. METHODS: The lipidomic profile including fatty acids, lipid classes, lipoprotein distribution, and oxylipins was examined multi- and uni-variately in 12 healthy subjects pre vs. post six weeks of ω3 fatty acids (1.9 g/d eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and 1.5 g/d docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]). RESULTS: Total lipidomic and oxylipin profiles were significantly different pre vs. post treatment across all subjects (p=0.00007 and p=0.00002 respectively). There was a strong correlation between oxylipin profiles and EPA and DHA incorporated into different lipid classes (r(2)=0.93). However, strikingly divergent responses among individuals were also observed. Both ω3 and ω6 fatty acid metabolites displayed a large degree of variation among the subjects. For example, in half of the subjects, two arachidonic acid cyclooxygenase products, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2), and a lipoxygenase product, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) significantly decreased post intervention, whereas in the other half they either did not change or increased. The EPA lipoxygenase metabolite 12-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (12-HEPE) varied among subjects from an 82% decrease to a 5,000% increase. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that certain defined responses to ω3 fatty acid intervention were consistent across all subjects. However, there was also a high degree of inter-individual variability in certain aspects of lipid metabolism. This lipidomic based phenotyping approach demonstrated that individual responsiveness to ω3 fatty acids is highly variable and measurable, and could be used as a means to assess the effectiveness of ω3 interventions in modifying disease risk and determining metabolic phenotype.|Core A|2013|PLoS ONE (PloS one)||Nording, Yang, Georgi, Hegedus Karbowski, German, Weiss, Hogg, Trygg, Hammock, Zivkovic.

Influence of nitrogen source on NDMA formation during chlorination of diuron|Chen, Wei-Hsiang; Young, Thomas M.|Ammonia/chemistry; Dimethylnitrosamine/chemistry; Diuron/chemistry; Halogenation; Herbicides/chemistry; Nitrates/chemistry; Nitrites/chemistry; Nitrogen/chemistry; Water Pollution, Chemical/analysis|N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is formed during chlorination of water containing the herbicide diuron (N'-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-N,N-dimethylurea) but formation is greatly enhanced in the presence of ammonia (chloramination). Groundwater impacted by agricultural runoff may contain diuron and relatively high total nitrogen concentrations; this study examines the impact of the nitrogen form (ammonium, nitrite or nitrate) on NDMA formation during chlorination of such waters. NDMA formation during chlorination of diuron increased in the order nitrite<nitrate<ammonium for a given chlorine, nitrogen, and diuron dose. Formation of dichloramine seemed to fully explain enhanced NDMA formation in the presence of ammonium. Nitrate unexpectedly enhanced nitrosation of diuron derivatives to form NDMA compared to the cases of no added nitrogen or nitrite addition. Nitrite addition is less effective because it consumes more chlorine and produces intermediates that react rapidly with diuron and its aromatic byproducts. Differences between surface water and groundwater in nitrogen forms and concentrations and disinfection approaches suggest strategies to reduce NDMA formation should vary with drinking water source.|1|2009|Water Res.

Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase contributes to the anti-inflammatory effect of antimicrobial triclocarban in a murine model|Liu, Jun-Yan; Qiu, Hong; Morisseau, Christophe; Hwang, Sung Hee; Tsai, Hsing-Ju; Ulu, Arzu; Chiamvimonvat, Nipavan; Hammock, Bruce D.|Animals; Anti-Infective Agents/pharmacology; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Carbanilides/pharmacology; Cytokines/blood; Epoxide Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors; Humans; Inflammation/blood/drug therapy/enzymology; Kinetics; Male; Mice; Models, Molecular; Oxylipins/blood; Random Allocation|The increasing use of the antimicrobial triclocarban (TCC) in personal care products (PCPs) has resulted in concern regarding environmental pollution. TCC is a potent inhibitor of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). Inhibitors of sEH (sEHIs) are anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive and cardio-protective in multiple animal models. However, the in vivo effects anticipated from a sEHI have not been reported for TCC. Here we demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effects in vivo of TCC in a murine model. TCC was employed in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged murine model. Systolic blood pressure, plasma levels of several inflammatory cytokines and chemokine, and metabolomic profile of plasma oxylipins were determined. TCC significantly reversed LPS-induced morbid hypotension in a time-dependent manner. TCC significantly repressed the increased release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokine caused by LPS. Furthermore, TCC significantly shifted the oxylipin profile in vivo in a time-dependent manner towards resolution of inflammation as expected from a sEHI. These results demonstrated that at the doses used TCC is anti-inflammatory in the murine model. This study suggests that TCC may provide some benefits in humans in addition to its antimicrobial activities due to its potent inhibition of sEH. It may be a promising starting point for developing new low volume high value applications of TCC. However these biological effects also caution against the general over use of TCC in PCPs.|5|2011|Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol.

Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase enhances the anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin and 5-lipoxygenase activation protein inhibitor in a murine model|Liu, Jun-Yan; Yang, Jun; Inceoglu, Bora; Qiu, Hong; Ulu, Arzu; Hwang, Sung-Hee; Chiamvimonvat, Nipavan; Hammock, Bruce D.|Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology; Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase; Arachidonic Acid/metabolism; Aspirin/pharmacology; Benzoates/pharmacology; Blood Pressure/drug effects; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Enzyme Activation; Epoxide Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids/blood; Indoles/pharmacology; Inflammation/drug therapy; Lipopolysaccharides/toxicity; Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/metabolism; Urea/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology|Inflammation is a multi-staged process whose expansive phase is thought to be driven by acutely released arachidonic acid (AA) and its metabolites. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), or soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is known to be anti-inflammatory. Inhibition of sEH stabilizes the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) products epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). Here we used a non-selective COX inhibitor aspirin, a 5-lipoxygenase activation protein (FLAP) inhibitor MK886, and a sEH inhibitor t-AUCB to selectively modulate the branches of AA metabolism in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged murine model. We used metabolomic profiling to simultaneously monitor representative AA metabolites of each branch. In addition to the significant crosstalk among branches of the AA cascade during selective modulation of COX, LOX, or sEH, we demonstrated that co-administration of t-AUCB enhanced the anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin or MK886, which was evidenced by the observations that co-administration resulted in favorable eicosanoid profiles and better control of LPS-mediated hypotension as well as hepatic protein expression of COX-2 and 5-LOX. Targeted disruption of the sEH gene displayed a parallel profile to that produced by t-AUCB. These observations demonstrate a significant level of crosstalk among the three major branches of the AA cascade and that they are not simply parallel pathways. These data illustrate that inhibition of sEH by both pharmacological intervention and gene knockout enhances the anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin and MK886, suggesting the possibility of modulating multiple branches to achieve better therapeutic effects.|Core A|2010|Biochem.

Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase is renoprotective in 5/6 nephrectomized Ren-2 transgenic hypertensive rats|Kujal, Petr; Čertíková Chábová, Vera; Škaroupková, Petra; Husková, Zuzana; Vernerová, Zdena; Kramer, Herbert J.; Walkowska, Agnieszka; Kompanowska-Jezierska, Elzbieta; Sadowski, Janusz; Kitada, Kento; Nishiyama, Akira; Hwang, Sung H.; Hammock, Bruce D.; Imig, John D.; Červenka, Ludek||1. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that increasing kidney tissue concentrations of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) by preventing their degradation to the biologically inactive dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETEs) using blockade of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) would attenuate the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). 2. Ren-2 transgenic rats (TGR) after 5/6 renal mass reduction (5/6 NX) served as a model of CKD associated with angiotensin (Ang) II-dependent hypertension. Soluble epoxide hydrolase was inhibited using cis-4-[4-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)cyclohexyloxy]benzoic acid (c-AUCB; 3 mg/L drinking water) for 20 weeks after 5/6 NX. Sham-operated normotensive transgene-negative Hannover Sprague-Dawley (HanSD) rats served as controls. 3. When applied in TGR subjected to 5/6 NX, c-AUCB treatment improved survival rate, prevented the increase in blood pressure, retarded the progression of cardiac hypertrophy, reduced proteinuria and the degree of glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury and reduced glomerular volume. All these organ-protective actions were associated with normalization of the intrarenal EETs:DHETEs ratio, an index of the availability of biologically active EETs, to levels observed in sham-operated HanSD rats. There were no significant concurrent changes of increased intrarenal AngII content. 4. Together, these results show that 5/6 NX TGR exhibit a profound deficiency of intrarenal availability of active epoxygenase metabolites (EETs), which probably contributes to the progression of CKD in this model of AngII-dependent hypertension, and that restoration of intrarenal availability of EETs using long-term c-AUCB treatment exhibits substantial renoprotective actions.|5|2014|Clin.

Flushing is thought to be due to release of the vasodilatory prostanoids prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and prostaglandin E2 from arachidonic acid metabolism through the cyclooxygenase pathway. Arachidonic acid is also metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, which is regulated, in part, by the enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). METHODS: These experiments used an established murine model in which ear tissue perfusion was measured by laser Doppler to test the hypothesis that inhibition of sEH would limit niacin-induced flushing. RESULTS: Niacin-induced flushing was reduced from 506 ± 126% to 213 ± 39% in sEH knockout animals. Pharmacologic treatment with 3 structurally distinct sEH inhibitors similarly reduced flushing in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal reduction to 143% ± 15% of baseline flow using a concentration of 1 mg/kg TPAU (1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-acetylpiperidin-4-yl) urea). Systemically administered PGD2 caused ear vasodilation, which was not changed by either pharmacologic sEH inhibition or sEH gene deletion. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of sEH markedly reduces niacin-induced flushing in this model without an apparent effect on the response to PGD2. sEH inhibition may be a new therapeutic approach to limit flushing in humans.|5|2012|J.

Inhibition of the soluble epoxide hydrolase by tyrosine nitration|Barbosa-Sicard, Eduardo; Frömel, Timo; Keserü, Benjamin; Brandes, Ralf P.; Morisseau, Christophe; Hammock, Bruce D.; Braun, Thomas; Krüger, Marcus; Fleming, Ingrid|Animals; Cells, Cultured; Endothelial Cells/cytology/enzymology; Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism; Epoxide Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Obese; Molsidomine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Oxidative Stress; Peroxynitrous Acid/metabolism; Tyrosine/metabolism|Inhibition of the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) has beneficial effects on vascular inflammation and hypertension indicating that the enzyme may be a promising target for drug development. As the enzymatic core of the hydrolase domain of the human sEH contains two tyrosine residues (Tyr(383) and Tyr(466)) that are theoretically crucial for enzymatic activity, we addressed the hypothesis that the activity of the sEH may be affected by nitrosative stress. Epoxide hydrolase activity was detected in human and murine endothelial cells as well in HEK293 cells and could be inhibited by either authentic peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) or the ONOO(-) generator 3-morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN-1). Protection of the enzymatic core with 1-adamantyl-3-cyclohexylurea in vitro decreased sensitivity to SIN-1. Both ONOO(-) and SIN-1 elicited the tyrosine nitration of the sEH protein and mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic fragments revealed nitration on several tyrosine residues including Tyr(383) and Tyr(466). Mutation of the latter residues to phenylalanine was sufficient to abrogate epoxide hydrolase activity. In vivo, streptozotocin-induced diabetes resulted in the tyrosine nitration of the sEH in murine lungs and a significant decrease in its activity. Taken together, these data indicate that the activity of the sEH can be regulated by the tyrosine nitration of the protein. Moreover, nitrosative stress would be expected to potentiate the physiological actions of arachidonic acid epoxides by preventing their metabolism to the corresponding diols.|5|2009|J. Biol. Chem.

Intakes and breast-milk concentrations of essential fatty acids are low among Bangladeshi women with 24-48-month-old children|Yakes, Elizabeth A.; Arsenault, Joanne E.; Munirul Islam, M.; Hossain, Mohammad B.; Ahmed, Tahmeed; Bruce German, J.; Gillies, Laura A.; Shafiqur Rahman, Ahmed; Drake, Christiana; Jamil, Kazi M.; Lewis, Bess L.; Brown, Kenneth H.|Adolescent; Adult; Bangladesh; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet; Dietary Fats/analysis; Energy Intake; Fatty Acids, Essential/administration & dosage/analysis; Female; Food Analysis; Humans; Lactation/physiology; Middle Aged; Milk, Human/chemistry; Poverty Areas; Rural Population; Young Adult|Maternal fat intake and adipose reserves are major sources of PUFA during lactation. The present study examined the cross-sectional relationship between prolonged breast-feeding and maternal BMI, assessed adequacy of fat intake among lactating and non-lactating mothers of children 24-48 months of age and determined breast-milk fatty acid composition. Multi-stage sampling was used to select a representative sample of mothers from two rural districts in Bangladesh (n 474). Dietary data were collected during two non-consecutive 24 h periods via 12 h in-home daytime observations and recall. The National Cancer Institute method for episodically consumed foods was used to estimate usual intake distributions. Breast milk samples were collected from ninety-eight women, and breast-milk fatty acid methyl esters were quantified using GC. Approximately 42 % of lactating v. 26 % of non-lactating mothers were underweight (BMI < 18·5 kg/m2; P = 0·0003). The maternal diet was low in total fat (approximately 8 % of mean total energy) and food sources of PUFA, including oil and animal source foods, resulting in a low estimated mean total consumption of PUFA (5·1 g/d). Almost all women were estimated to consume less than the recommended intake levels for total fat, total PUFA, α-linolenic acid (ALA) and DHA. Median breast-milk linoleic acid (8·5 % weight) and ALA (0·2 %) concentrations were among the lowest reported in the literature, in contrast with arachidonic acid (0·5 %) and DHA (0·3 %) concentrations, which were mid-range. Bangladeshi women in general, and especially those who practise prolonged breast-feeding, may benefit from increased consumption of food sources of PUFA.|Core A|2011|Br. J. Nutr.

Isolation of alpaca anti-hapten heavy chain single domain antibodies for development of sensitive immunoassay|Kim, Hee-Joo; McCoy, Mark R.; Majkova, Zuzana; Dechant, Julie E.; Gee, Shirley J.; Tabares-da Rosa, Sofia; González-Sapienza, Gualberto G.; Hammock, Bruce D.|Animals; Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/immunology/isolation & purification/urine; Benzoates/immunology; Camelids, New World/immunology; Cross Reactions; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Haptens/immunology; Humans; Immunoassay; Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/immunology; Male; Peptide Library; Pyrethrins/immunology; Recombinant Proteins/immunology; Single-Chain Antibodies/immunology/isolation & purification/urine|Some unique subclasses of Camelidae antibodies are devoid of the light chain, and the antigen binding site is comprised exclusively of the variable domain of the heavy chain (VHH). Although conventional antibodies dominate current assay development, recombinant VHHs have a high potential as alternative reagents for the next generation of immunoassay. We expressed VHHs from an immunized alpaca and developed a VHH-based immunoassay using 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a major metabolite of pyrethroid insecticides as a model system. A phage VHH library was constructed, and seven VHH clones were selected by competitive binding with 3-PBA. The best immunoassay developed with one of these VHHs showed an IC(50) of 1.4 ng/mL (limit of detection (LOD) = 0.1 ng/mL). These parameters were further improved by using the phage borne VHH, IC(50) = 0.1 ng/mL and LOD = 0.01 ng/mL. Both assays showed a similar tolerance to methanol and dimethylsulfoxide up to 50% in assay buffer. The assay was highly specific to 3-PBA and its 4-hydroxylated derivative, 4-hydroxy 3-PBA, (150% cross reactivity) with negligible cross reactivity with other tested structural analogues, and the recovery from spiked urine sample ranged from 80 to 112%. In conclusion, a highly specific and sensitive VHH for 3-PBA was developed using sequences from immunized alpaca and phage display technology for antibody selection.|3|2012|Anal. Chem.

Isolation of alpaca anti-idiotypic heavy-chain single-domain antibody for the aflatoxin immunoassay|Wang, Yanru; Li, Peiwu; Majkova, Zuzana; Bever, Candace R S; Kim, Hee Joo; Zhang, Qi; Dechant, Julie E.; Gee, Shirley J.; Hammock, Bruce D.||Anti-idiotypic antibodies recognize the antigenic determinants of an antibody, thus they can be used as surrogate antigens.

In this work, we constructed an antibody phage library from the mRNA of an alpaca immunized with an antiaflatoxin monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1C11. Three anti-idiotypic VHH antibodies were isolated and applied to immunoassay toward aflatoxin as a coating antigen. The best immunoassay developed with one of these VHH antibodies shows an IC50 of 0.16 ng/mL toward aflatoxin B1 and cross-reactivity toward aflatoxin B2, G1, and G2 of 90.4%, 54.4%, and 37.7%, respectively. The VHH-based immunoassay was successfully applied to the analysis of peanuts, corn, and rice, which are the predominant commodities regularly contaminated by aflatoxins. A good correlation (r(2) = 0.89) was found between the data obtained from the conventional ELISA and the ELISA based on a VHH coating antigen for the analysis of aflatoxins in peanuts and feedstuff. The use of biotechnology in developing the surrogate, the absence of standard aflatoxin and organic solvents in the synthesis procedures, and the reproducibility of the VHH antibody makes it an ideal strategy for replacing conventional synthesized antigens.|3|2013|Anal.

Lack of ligand-selective binding of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor to putative DNA binding sites regulating expression of Bax and paraoxonase 1 genes|DeGroot, Danica E.; Hayashi, Ai; Denison, Michael S.||The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that mediates the biological and toxicological effects of structurally diverse chemicals through its ability to bind specific DNA recognition sites (dioxin responsive elements (DREs)), and activate transcription of adjacent genes. While the DRE has a highly conserved consensus sequence, it has been suggested that the nucleotide specificity of AhR DNA binding may be ligand-dependent. The upstream regulatory regions of the murine Bax and human paraoxonase 1 (PON1) genes reportedly contain unique DRE-like sequences that respond to AhRs activated by some ligands but not others. Given the significant implications of this observation to understanding the diversity in AhR responses and that of other ligand-dependent nuclear receptors, a combination of DNA binding, nuclear translocation and gene expression analysis was used to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these ligand-selective responses. Although known AhR agonists stimulated AhR nuclear translocation, DRE binding and gene expression, the ligand-selective DRE-like DNA elements identified in the Bax and PON1 upstream regulatory regions failed to bind ligand-activated AhR or confer AhR-responsiveness upon a reporter gene. These results argue against the reported ligand-selectivity of AhR DNA binding and suggest DNA binding by ligand activated AhR involves DRE-containing DNA.|5|2014|Arch. Biochem. Biophys.

Land use and climatic factors structure regional patterns in soil microbial communities|Drenovsky, R. E.; Steenwerth, K. L.; Jackson, L. E.; Scow, K. M.|California; disturbance; microbial biomass; plfa; soil microbial community; Water; fatty-acid profiles; plant-species richness; diversity; biogeography; responses; dynamics; quality; landscape; Bacteria; tillage|AIM: Although patterns are emerging for macroorganisms, we have limited understanding of the factors determining soil microbial community composition and productivity at large spatial extents. The overall objective of this study was to discern the drivers of microbial community composition at the extent of biogeographical provinces and regions. We hypothesized that factors associated with land use and climate would drive soil microbial community composition and biomass. LOCATION: Great Basin Province, Desert Province and California Floristic Province, California, USA. METHODS: Using phospholipid fatty acid analysis, we compared microbial communities across eight land-use types sampled throughout the State of California, USA (n = 1117). RESULTS: The main factor driving composition and microbial biomass was land-use type, especially as related to water availability and disturbance. Dry soils were more enriched in Gram-negative bacteria and fungi, and wetter soils were more enriched in Gram-positive, anaerobic and sulphate-reducing bacteria. Microbial biomass was lowest in ecosystems with the wettest and driest soils. Disturbed soils had less fungal and more Gram-positive bacterial biomass than wildland soils. However, some factors known to influence microbial communities, such as soil pH and specific plant taxa, were not important here. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Distinct microbial communities were associated with land-use types and disturbance at the regional extent. Overall, soil water availability was an important determinant of soil microbial community composition. However, because of the inclusion of managed and irrigated agricultural ecosystems, the effect of precipitation was not significant. Effects of environmental and management factors, such as flooding, tillage and irrigation, suggest that agricultural management can have larger effects on soil microbial communities than elevation and precipitation gradients.|1|2010|Global Ecol Biogeogr (Global Ecology and Biogeography)||Drenovsky, Steenwerth, Jackson, Scow.

To examine the mechanisms responsible for the promiscuity in AhR ligand binding, we determined the effects of mutations within the AhR ligand-binding domain (LBD) on the activity of diverse AhR ligands. Site-directed mutagenesis identified Ile319 of the mouse AhR and, to a lesser extent, Phe318 as residues involved in ligand-selective modulation of AhR transformation using a panel of 12 AhR ligands. These ligands could be categorized into four distinct structurally related groups based on their ability to activate AhR mutants at position 319 in vitro. The mutation I319K was selectively activated by FICZ and not by other examined ligands in vitro and in cell culture. F318L and F318A mutations resulted in the conversion of AhR agonists β-naphthoflavone and 3-methylcholanthrene, respectively, into partial agonists/antagonists. Hsp90 binding to the AhR was decreased with several mutations and was inversely correlated with AhR ligand-binding promiscuity. Together, these data define overlapping amino acid residues within the AhR LBD involved in the selectivity of ligand binding, the agonist or antagonist mode of ligand binding, and hsp90 binding and provide insights into the ligand diversity of AhR activators.|5|2014|Mol.

Lipid mediator serum profiles in asthmatics significantly shift following dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids|Lundström, Susanna L.; Yang, Jun; Brannan, John D.; Haeggström, Jesper Z.; Hammock, Bruce D.; Nair, Parameswaran; O'Byrne, Paul; Dahlén, Sven-Erik; Wheelock, Craig E.||SCOPE: In contrast to well-characterized PUFA levels in serum, little is known regarding their downstream metabolic products. However, many of these compounds are lipid mediators with prominent roles during pro- and antiinflammatory processes. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this double blind crossover study on asthmatics, shifts in serum levels of ω-3 and ω-6 PUFA-derived oxidized fatty acids (e.g. eicosanoids, oxylipins) were quantified following dietary fish oil supplementation. Serum was obtained from subjects following fasting at three occasions; (i) prior to supplementation, (ii) following a 3-week supplement intake of either placebo or fish oil, and (iii) following a 3-week washout period with a subsequent 3-week period of either fish oil or placebo supplement. A total of 87 oxylipins representing cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolic pathways were screened via LC-MS/MS. The primary alterations observed were in CYP- and 15-LOX-derived EPA- and CYP-derived DHA oxylipins. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that intake of an ω-3 rich diet alters not only the PUFA ratio, but also the ratio of downstream oxylipins. These data further support that dietary manipulation with ω-3 PUFAs affects not only PUFA levels, but importantly also the downstream metabolic profile.|Core A|2013|Mol Nutr Food Res (Molecular nutrition & food research)||Lundström, Yang, Brannan, Haeggström, Hammock, Nair, O'Byrne, Dahlén, Wheelock.

Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, are responsive to environmental influences and have long-lasting consequences. Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have complex neurodevelopmental origins whereby both genetic and environmental factors are implicated. Rett syndrome is an X-linked ASD caused by mutations in the epigenetic factor methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2). In this study, an Mecp2 truncation mutant mouse (Mecp2(308)) with social behavioral defects was used to explore the long-lasting effects of PBDE exposure in a genetically and epigenetically susceptible model. Mecp2(308/+) dams were perinatally exposed daily to 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether 47 (BDE-47) and bred to wild-type C57BL/6J males, and the offspring of each sex and genotype were examined for developmental, behavioral and epigenetic outcomes. Perinatal BDE-47 exposure negatively impacted fertility of Mecp2(308/+) dams and preweaning weights of females. Global hypomethylation of adult brain DNA was observed specifically in female offspring perinatally exposed to BDE-47 and it coincided with reduced sociability in a genotype-independent manner. A reversing interaction of Mecp2 genotype on BDE-47 exposure was observed in a short-term memory test of social novelty that corresponded to increased Dnmt3a levels specifically in BDE-47-exposed Mecp2(308/+) offspring. In contrast, learning and long-term memory in the Morris water maze was impaired by BDE-47 exposure in female Mecp2(308/+) offspring. These results demonstrate that a genetic and environmental interaction relevant to social and cognitive behaviors shows sexual dimorphism, epigenetic dysregulation, compensatory molecular mechanisms and specific behavioral deficits.|5|2012|Hum.

Luminescent lanthanide nanoparticles as labels in DNA microarrays for quantification of methyl tertiary butyl ether degrading bacteria|Son, Ahjeong; Nichkova, Mikaela; Dosev, Dosi; Kennedy, Ian M.; Hristova, Krassimira R.|Bacteria/genetics/metabolism; Lanthanoid Series Elements/chemistry; Metal Nanoparticles; Methyl Ethers/metabolism; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; RNA, Bacterial/genetics; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/genetics|We report application of lanthanide nanoparticles for DNA quantification in a microarray platform as a substitute for conventional organic fluorophores. A non-PCR based DNA microarray assay for quantifying bacteria capable of biodegrading methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) was demonstrated. Probe DNA was immobilized on a glass surface, hybridized with biotinylated target DNA and subsequently incubated with Neutravidin-biofunctionalized nanoparticles. The fluorescence spot intensities, measured by a commercial laser scanner, show a linear relationship (R2 = 0.98) with bacterial 16S rDNA over a range of target DNA concentrations, while the background fluorescence remained low. In addition, nanoparticles fluorescence shows a stronger intensity than Quasar570 (Cy3). Present sensitivity of the assay is 10 pM of target DNA. The selectivity of the DNA-nanoparticle-probes to discriminate a non-target DNA with two base pairs mismatch in the 16S rDNA gene sequence was shown. The use of Eu:Gd2O3 nanoparticles as biolabels provides a relatively non-toxic, inexpensive, rapid and sensitive alternative to the materials currently used in DNA microarrays.|2|2008|J Nanosci Nanotechnol (Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology)||Son, Nichkova, Dosev, Kennedy, Hristova.

Magnetic scanometric DNA microarray detection of methyl tertiary butyl ether degrading bacteria for environmental monitoring|Chan, Mei-Lin; Jaramillo, Gerardo; Hristova, Krassimira R.; Horsley, David A.|Betaproteobacteria/isolation & purification/metabolism; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biosensing Techniques/instrumentation; DNA, Bacterial/analysis/genetics; Environmental Monitoring/instrumentation; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Magnetics/instrumentation; Methyl Ethers/chemistry; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/instrumentation|A magnetoresistive biosensing platform based on a single magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) scanning probe and DNA microarrays labeled with magnetic particles has been developed to provide an inexpensive, sensitive and reliable detection of DNA. The biosensing platform was demonstrated on a DNA microarray assay for quantifying bacteria capable of degrading methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), where concentrations as low as 10 pM were detectable. Synthetic probe bacterial DNA was immobilized on a microarray glass slide surface, hybridized with the 48 base pair long biotinylated target DNA and subsequently incubated with streptavidin-coated 2.8 μm diameter magnetic particles. The biosensing platform then makes use of a micron-sized MTJ sensor that was raster scanned across a 3 mm by 5 mm glass slide area to capture the stray magnetic field from the tagged DNA and extract two dimensional magnetic field images of the microarray. The magnetic field output is then averaged over each 100 μm diameter DNA array spot to extract the magnetic spot intensity, analogous to the fluorescence spot intensity used in conventional optical scanners. The magnetic scanning result is compared with results from a commercial laser scanner and particle coverage optical counting to demonstrate the dynamic range and linear sensitivity of the biosensing platform as a potentially inexpensive, sensitive and portable alternative for DNA microarray detection for field applications.|2|2011|Biosens Bioelectron (Biosensors & bioelectronics)||Chan, Jaramillo, Hristova, Horsley.

Malassezia Yeasts Produce a Collection of Exceptionally Potent Activators of the Ah (Dioxin) Receptor Detected in Diseased Human Skin|Magiatis, Prokopios; Pappas, Periklis; Gaitanis, George; Mexia, Nikitia; Melliou, Eleni; Galanou, Maria; Vlachos, Christophoros; Stathopoulou, Konstantina; Skaltsounis, Alexios Leandros; Marselos, Marios; Velegraki, Aristea; Denison, Michael S.; Bassukas, Ioannis D.||Malassezia yeasts are commensal microorganisms, which under insufficiently understood conditions can become pathogenic. We have previously shown that specific strains isolated from diseased human skin can preferentially produce agonists of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), whose activation has been linked to certain skin diseases. Investigation of skin scale extracts from patients with Malassezia-associated diseases demonstrated 10- to 1,000-fold higher AhR-activating capacity than control skin extracts. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the patients' extracts revealed the presence of indirubin, 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), indolo[3,2-b]carbazole (ICZ), malassezin, and pityriacitrin. The same compounds were also identified in 9 out of 12 Malassezia species culture extracts tested, connecting their presence in skin scales with this yeast. Studying the activity of the Malassezia culture extracts and pure metabolites in HaCaT cells by reverse transcriptase real-time PCR revealed significant alterations in mRNA levels of the endogenous AhR-responsive genes Cyp1A1, Cyp1B1, and AhRR. Indirubin- and FICZ-activated AhR in HaCaT and human HepG2 cells with significantly higher, yet transient, potency as compared with the prototypical AhR ligand, dioxin. In loco synthesis of these highly potent AhR inducers by Malassezia yeasts could have a significant impact on skin homeostatic mechanisms and disease development.Journal of Investigative Dermatology advance online publication, 4 April 2013; doi:10.1038/jid.2013.92.|5|2013|J.

Mass discharge in a tracer plume: evaluation of the Theissen Polygon Method|Mackay, Douglas M.; Einarson, Murray D.; Kaiser, Phil M.; Nozawa-Inoue, Mamie; Goyal, Sham; Chakraborty, Irina; Rasa, Ehsan; Scow, Kate M.||"A tracer plume was created within a thin aquifer by injection for 299 d of two adjacent ""sub-plumes"" to represent one type of plume heterogeneity encountered in practice. The plume was monitored by snapshot sampling of transects of fully screened wells. The mass injection rate and total mass injected were known. Using all wells in each transect (0.77 m well spacing, 1.4 points/m(2) sampling density), the Theissen Polygon Method (TPM) yielded apparently accurate mass discharge (M(d) ) estimates at three transects for 12 snapshots. When applied to hypothetical sparser transects using subsets of the wells with average spacing and sampling density from 1.55 to 5.39 m and 0.70 to 0.20 points/m(2) , respectively, the TPM accuracy depended on well spacing and location of the wells in the hypothesized transect with respect to the sub-plumes. Potential error was relatively low when the well spacing was less than the widths of the sub-plumes (>0.35 points/m(2) ). Potential error increased for well spacing similar to or greater than the sub-plume widths, or when less than 1% of the plume area was sampled. For low density sampling of laterally heterogeneous plumes, small changes in groundwater flow direction can lead to wide fluctuations in M(d) estimates by the TPM. However, sampling conducted when flow is known or likely to be in a preferred direction can potentially allow more useful comparisons of M(d) over multiyear time frames, such as required for performance evaluation of natural attenuation or engineered remediation systems."|1|2012|Ground Water (Ground water)||Mackay, Einarson, Kaiser, Nozawa-Inoue, Goyal, Chakraborty, Rasa, Scow.

Maternal transfer of BDE-47 to offspring and neurobehavioral development in C57BL/6J mice|Koenig, Claire M.; Lango, Jozsef; Pessah, Isaac N.; Berman, Robert F.||Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are flame retardants used worldwide in a variety of commercial goods, and are now widely found in both environmental and biological samples. BDE-47 is one of the most pervasive of these PBDE congeners and therefore is of particular concern. In this study C57BL/6J mice were exposed perinatally to 0.03, 0.1 or 1mg/kg/day of BDE-47, a dose range chosen to encompass human exposure levels. Tissue levels of BDE-47 were measured in the blood, brain, fat and milk of dams and in whole fetal homogenate and blood and brain of pups on gestational day (GD) 15, and postnatal days (PNDs) 1, 10 and 21. From GD 15 to PND 1 levels of BDE-47 increased within dam tissues and then decreased from PNDs 1 to 21. Over the period of lactation levels in dam milk were comparatively high when compared to both brain and blood for all dose groups. Measurable levels of BDE-47 were found in the fetus on GD 15 confirming gestational exposure. From PNDs 1 to 21, levels of BDE-47 in pup tissue increased over the period of lactation due to the transfer of BDE-47 through milk. Behavioral tests of fine motor function and learning and memory were carried out between postnatal weeks 5-17 in order to evaluate the neurobehavioral toxicity of BDE-47. Behavioral deficits were only seen in the Barnes spatial maze where mice in the three exposure groups had longer latencies and traveled longer distances to find the escape hole when compared to vehicle control mice. These results support the conclusions that perinatal exposure to BDE-47 can have neurodevelopmental consequences, and that lactational exposure represents a significant exposure risk during development.|5|2012|Neurotoxicol Teratol (Neurotoxicology and teratology)||Koenig, Lango, Pessah, Berman.

All experiments were conducted in a 2 L batch reactor without considering CO(2) effect on algae's growth and lipid production. Biomass and lipid production increased with glycerin as carbon source and were well described by the logistic and Luedeking-Piret equations respectively. Model predictions were in satisfactory agreement with measured data and the mode of lipid production was growth-associated. Sensitivity analysis was applied to examine the effects of certain important parameters on model performance. Results showed that S(0), the initial concentration of glycerin, was the most significant factor for algae growth and lipid production. This model is applicable for prediction of other single cell algal species but model testing is recommended before scaling up the fermentation of process.|1|2011|Bioresour. Technol.

Measuring Submicron-Sized Fractionated Particulate Matter on Aluminum Impactor Disks|Buchholz, B. A.; Zermeno, P.; Hwang, H. M.; Young, T. M.; Guilderson, T. P.||Sub-micron sized airborne particulate matter (PM) is not collected well on regular quartz or glass fiber filter papers. We used a micro-orifice uniform deposit impactor (MOUDI) to fractionate PM into six size fractions and deposit it on specially designed high purity thin aluminum disks. The MOUDI separated PM into fractions 56-100 nm, 100-180 nm, 180-320 nm, 320-560 nm, 560-1000 nm, and 1000-1800 nm. Since the MOUDI has a low flow rate (30 L/min), it takes several days to collect sufficient carbon on 47 mm foil disks. The small carbon mass (20-200 microgram C) and large aluminum substrate (~25 mg Al) present several challenges to production of graphite targets for accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) analysis. The Al foil consumes large amounts of oxygen as it is heated and tends to melt into quartz combustion tubes, causing gas leaks.

Metabolic activation of the antibacterial agent triclocarban by cytochrome P450 1A1 yielding glutathione adducts|Schebb, Nils Helge; Muvvala, Jaya B.; Morin, Dexter; Buckpitt, Alan R.; Hammock, Bruce D.; Rice, Robert H.||Triclocarban (3,4,4'-trichlorocarbanilide; TCC) is an antibacterial agent used in personal care products such as bar soaps. Small amounts of chemical are absorbed through the epidermis. Recent studies show that residues of reactive TCC metabolites are bound covalently to proteins in incubations with keratinocytes, raising concerns about the potential toxicity of this antimicrobial agent. To obtain additional information on metabolic activation of TCC, this study characterized the reactive metabolites trapped as glutathione conjugates. Incubations were carried out with (14)C-labeled TCC, recombinant CYP1A1 or CYP1B1, coexpressed with cytochrome P450 reductase, glutathione-S-transferases (GSH), and an NADPH-generating system. Incubations containing CYP1A1, but not 1B1, led to formation of a single TCC-GSH adduct with a conversion rate of 1% of parent compound in 2 hours. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry and diagnostic fragmentation, the adduct was tentatively identified as 3,4-dichloro-3'-glutathionyl-4'-hydroxycarbanilide. These findings support the hypothesis that TCC is activated by oxidative dehalogenation and oxidation to a quinone imine. Incubations of TCDD-induced keratinocytes with (14)C-TCC yielded a minor radioactive peak coeluting with TCC-GSH. Thus, we conclude that covalent protein modification by TCC in TCDD-induced human keratinocyte incubations is mainly caused by activation of TCC by CYP1A1 via a dehalogenated TCC derivative as reactive species.|5|2014|Drug Metab.

Metabolic profiling of murine plasma reveals an unexpected biomarker in rofecoxib-mediated cardiovascular events|Liu, Jun-Yan; Li, Ning; Yang, Jun; Li, Nan; Qiu, Hong; Ai, Ding; Chiamvimonvat, Nipavan; Zhu, Yi; Hammock, Bruce D.|Animals; Biological Markers/blood; Bleeding Time; Blood Coagulation/drug effects; Blood Platelets/drug effects; Cardiovascular Diseases/blood/chemically induced/diagnosis; Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects; Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids/blood/pharmacology; Lactones/administration & dosage/adverse effects; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Platelet Aggregation/drug effects; Sulfones/administration & dosage/adverse effects|Chronic administration of high levels of selective COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs), particularly rofecoxib, valdecoxib, and parecoxib, increases risk for cardiovascular disease. Understanding the possibly multiple mechanisms underlying these adverse cardiovascular events is critical for evaluating the risks and benefits of coxibs and for development of safer coxibs. The current understanding of these mechanisms is likely incomplete. Using a metabolomics approach, we demonstrate that oral administration of rofecoxib for 3 mo results in a greater than 120-fold higher blood level of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), which correlates with a significantly shorter tail bleeding time in a murine model. We tested the hypothesis that this dramatic increase in 20-HETE is attributable to inhibition of its metabolism and that the shortened bleeding time following rofecoxib administration is attributable, in part, to this increase. The s.c. infusion of 20-HETE shortened the tail bleeding time dramatically. Neither 20-HETE biosynthesis nor cytochrome P4A-like immune reactivity was increased by rofecoxib administration, but 20-HETE production increased in vitro with the addition of coxib. 20-HETE is significantly more potent than its COX-mediated metabolites in shortening clotting time in vitro. Furthermore, 20-HETE but not rofecoxib significantly increases rat platelet aggregation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest 20-HETE as a marker of rofecoxib exposure and that inhibition of 20-HETE's degradation by rofecoxib is a partial explanation for its dramatic increase, the shortened bleeding time, and, possibly, the adverse cardiovascular events associated with rofecoxib.|Core A|2010|Proc.

Since the skin is the major route of triclocarban exposure, present work examined this possibility in cultured human keratinocytes. The results provide evidence for considerable biotransformation and protein adduct formation when cytochrome P450 activity is induced in the cells by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a model Ah receptor ligand. Since detecting low adduct levels in cells and tissues is difficult, we utilized the novel approach of accelerator mass spectrometry for this purpose. Exploiting the sensitivity of the method, we demonstrated that a substantial portion of triclocarban forms adducts with keratinocyte protein under the P450 inducing conditions employed.|5|2012|J.

Metabolomic profiling of regulatory lipid mediators in sputum from adult cystic fibrosis patients|Yang, Jun; Eiserich, Jason P.; Cross, Carroll E.; Morrissey, Brian M.; Hammock, Bruce D.|Adult; Aged; Anti-Inflammatory Agents/metabolism; Biological Markers/metabolism; Cystic Fibrosis/metabolism; Female; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Inflammation Mediators/metabolism; Male; Metabolomics; Middle Aged; Oxylipins/analysis/isolation & purification/metabolism; Sputum/chemistry; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Young Adult|Retained respiratory tract (RT) secretions, infection, and exuberant inflammatory responses are core abnormalities in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Factors contributing to the destructive CF airway inflammatory processes remain incompletely characterized. The pro-oxidative inflammatory CF RT milieu is known to contain enzymatically and nonenzymatically produced regulatory lipid mediators, a panel of structurally defined oxidized metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids known to play a role in pathology related to inflammation. Using an extraction protocol that maximizes recoveries of sputum-spiked deuterated standards, coupled with an LC/MS/MS detection system, this study presents a metabolomic method to assess a broad spectrum of regulatory lipid mediators in freshly obtained sputum from CF patients. A broad range of both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators was detected, including PGE2, PGD2, TXB2, LTB4, 6-trans-LTB4, 20-OH-LTB4, 20-COOH-LTB4, 20-HETE, 15-HETE, 11-HETE, 12-HETE, 8-HETE, 9-HETE, 5-HETE, EpETrEs, diols, resolvin E1, 15-deoxy-PGJ2, and LXA4. The vast majority of these oxylipins have not been reported previously in CF RT secretions. Whereas direct associations of individual proinflammatory lipid mediators with compromised lung function (FEV-1) were observed, the relationships were not robust. However, multiple statistical analyses revealed that the regulatory lipid mediators profile taken in aggregate proved to have a stronger association with lung function in relatively stable outpatient adult CF patients. Our data reveal a relative paucity of the anti-inflammatory lipid mediator lipoxin A4 in CF sputum. Patients displaying detectable levels of the anti-inflammatory lipid mediator resolvin E1 demonstrated a better lung function compared to those patients with undetectable levels. Our data suggest that comprehensive metabolomic profiling of regulatory lipid mediators in CF sputum should contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying CF RT inflammatory pathobiology.

Metals associated with stormwater-relevant brake and tire samples|McKenzie, Erica R.; Money, Jon E.; Green, Peter G.; Young, Thomas M.|Cadmium/analysis; Elements; Environmental Monitoring; Metals, Heavy/analysis; Motor Vehicles; Rain; Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis|Properly apportioning the loads of metals in highway stormwater runoff to the appropriate sources requires accurate data on source composition, especially regarding constituents that help to distinguish among sources. Representative tire and brake samples were collected from privately owned vehicles and aqueous extracts were analyzed for twenty-eight elements. Correlation principal components analysis (PCA) revealed that tires were most influenced by Zn, Pb, and Cu, while brakes were best characterized by Na and Fe followed by Ba, Cu, Mg, Mn, and K; the latter three may be due to roadside soil contributions. Notably elevated Cd contributions were found in several brake samples. A targeted Cd-plated brake rotor was sampled, producing results consistent with the elevated levels found in the larger sample population. This enriched source of Cd is of particular concern due to high toxicity of Cd in aquatic ecosystems.|1|2009|Sci. Total Environ. (The Science of the total environment)||McKenzie, Money, Green, Young.

Microbial biosafety of pilot-scale bioreactor treating MTBE and TBA-contaminated drinking water supply|Schmidt, Radomir; Klemme, David A.; Scow, Kate; Hristova, Krassimira|Bacteria/isolation & purification; Bioreactors; Colony Count, Microbial; Methyl Ethers/isolation & purification; Pilot Projects; Water Microbiology; Water Pollutants, Chemical/isolation & purification; Water Supply; tert-Butyl Alcohol/isolation & purification|A pilot-scale sand-based fluidized bed bioreactor (FBBR) was utilized to treat both methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) from a contaminated aquifer. To evaluate the potential for re-use of the treated water, we tested for a panel of water quality indicator microorganisms and potential waterborne pathogens including total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Shigella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, Aeromonas hydrophila, Legionella pneumophila, Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolytica and Mycobacterium avium in both influent and treated waters from the bioreactor. Total bacteria decreased during FBBR treatment. E. coli, Salmonella and Shigella spp., C. jejuni, V. cholerae, Y. enterocolytica and M. avium were not detected in aquifer water or bioreactor treated water samples. For those pathogens detected, including total coliforms, L. pneumophila and A. hydrophila, numbers were usually lower in treated water than influent samples, suggesting removal during treatment. The detection of particular bacterial species reflected their presence or absence in the influent waters.|1|2012|J. Hazard. Mater. (Journal of hazardous materials)||Schmidt, Klemme, Scow, Hristova.

Microbial community composition and carbon cycling within soil microenvironments of conventional, low-input, and organic cropping systems|Kong, Angela Y. Y.; Scow, Kate M.; Córdova-Kreylos, Ana Lucía; Holmes, William E.; Six, Johan||This study coupled stable isotope probing with phospholipid fatty acid analysis ((13)C-PLFA) to describe the role of microbial community composition in the short-term processing (i.e., C incorporation into microbial biomass and/or deposition or respiration of C) of root- versus residue-C and, ultimately, in long-term C sequestration in conventional (annual synthetic fertilizer applications), low-input (synthetic fertilizer and cover crop applied in alternating years), and organic (annual composted manure and cover crop additions) maize-tomato (Zea mays - Lycopersicum esculentum) cropping systems. During the maize growing season, we traced (13)C-labeled hairy vetch (Vicia dasycarpa) roots and residues into PLFAs extracted from soil microaggregates (53-250 μm) and silt-and-clay (<53 μm) particles. Total PLFA biomass was greatest in the organic (41.4 nmol g(-1) soil) and similar between the conventional and low-input systems (31.0 and 30.1 nmol g(-1) soil, respectively), with Gram-positive bacterial PLFA dominating the microbial communities in all systems. Although total PLFA-C derived from roots was over four times greater than from residues, relative distributions (mol%) of root- and residue-derived C into the microbial communities were not different among the three cropping systems. Additionally, neither the PLFA profiles nor the amount of root- and residue-C incorporation into the PLFAs of the microaggregates were consistently different when compared with the silt-and-clay particles. More fungal PLFA-C was measured, however, in microaggregates compared with silt-and-clay. The lack of differences between the mol% within the microbial communities of the cropping systems and between the PLFA-C in the microaggregates and the silt-and-clay may have been due to (i) insufficient differences in quality between roots and residues and/or (ii) the high N availability in these N-fertilized cropping systems that augmented the abilities of the microbial communities to process a wide range of substrate qualities. The main implications of this study are that (i) the greater short-term microbial processing of root- than residue-C can be a mechanistic explanation for the higher relative retention of root- over residue-C, but microbial community composition did not influence long-term C sequestration trends in the three cropping systems and (ii) in spite of the similarity between the microbial community profiles of the microaggregates and the silt-and-clay, more C was processed in the microaggregates by fungi, suggesting that the microaggregate is a relatively unique microenvironment for fungal activity.|1|2011|Soil Biol.

Minding the calcium store: Ryanodine receptor activation as a convergent mechanism of PCB toxicity|Pessah, Isaac N.; Cherednichenko, Gennady; Lein, Pamela J.|Calcium/metabolism; Environmental Pollutants/chemistry/toxicity; Humans; Polychlorinated Biphenyls/chemistry/toxicity; Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel/metabolism; Structure-Activity Relationship|Chronic low-level polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposures remain a significant public health concern since results from epidemiological studies indicate that PCB burden is associated with immune system dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, and impairment of the developing nervous system. Of these various adverse health effects, developmental neurotoxicity has emerged as a particularly vulnerable endpoint in PCB toxicity. Arguably the most pervasive biological effects of PCBs could be mediated by their ability to alter the spatial and temporal fidelity of Ca2+ signals through one or more receptor-mediated processes. This review will focus on our current knowledge of the structure and function of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in muscle and nerve cells and how PCBs and related non-coplanar structures alter these functions. The molecular and cellular mechanisms by which non-coplanar PCBs and related structures alter local and global Ca2+ signaling properties and the possible short and long-term consequences of these perturbations on neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration are reviewed.|5|2010|Pharmacol.

Mobilization of endocrine-disrupting chemicals and estrogenic activity in simulated rainfall runoff from land-applied biosolids|Giudice, Ben D.; Young, Thomas M.|Computer Simulation; Endocrine Disruptors/chemistry; Fertilizers; Metals, Heavy/chemistry; Models, Chemical; Phenols/chemistry; Rain/chemistry; Soil; Water Movements; Water Pollutants, Chemical/chemistry; Water Quality|Municipal biosolids are commonly applied to land as soil amendment or fertilizer as a form of beneficial reuse of what could otherwise be viewed as waste. Balanced against this benefit are potential risks to groundwater and surface water quality from constituents that may be mobilized during storm events. The objective of the present study was to characterize the mobilization of selected endocrine-disrupting compounds, heavy metals, and total estrogenic activity in rainfall runoff from land-applied biosolids. Rainfall simulations were conducted on soil plots amended with biosolids. Surface runoff and leachate was collected and analyzed for the endocrine-disrupting compounds bisphenol A, 17α-ethynylestradiol, triclocarban, triclosan, octylphenol, and nonylphenol; a suite of 16 metals; and estrogenic activity via the estrogen receptor-mediated chemical activated luciferase gene expression (ER-CALUX) bioassay. Triclocarban (2.3-17.3 ng/L), triclosan (<51-309 ng/L), and octylphenol (<4.9-203 ng/L) were commonly detected. Chromium (2.0-22 µg/L), Co (2.5-10 µg/L), Ni (28-235 µg/L), Cu (14-110 µg/L), As (1.2-2.7 µg/L), and Se (0.29-12 µg/L) were quantifiable over background levels. Triclosan, Ni, and Cu were detected at levels that might pose some risk to aquatic life, though levels of metals in the biosolids were well below the maximum allowable regulatory limits. The ER-CALUX results were mostly explained by background bisphenol A contamination and octylphenol in runoff, although unknown contributors or matrix effects were also found.|1|2011|Environ. Toxicol.

Modeling and predicting competitive sorption of organic compounds in soil|Faria, Isabel R.; Young, Thomas M.|Organic Chemicals/chemistry; Soil Pollutants/analysis; Structure-Activity Relationship|Binary systems consisting of 1,2-dichlorobenzene (12DCB) + competitor were investigated over a range of concentrations of competitor in three natural sorbents with distinct characteristics. Two models, the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) and the potential theory (Polanyi-based multisolute model), widely used in the prediction of multisolute sorption equilibrium from single-solute data, were used to simulate competitive sorption in our systems. The goal was to determine which multisolute model best represented the experimentally obtained multisolute data in natural sorbents of varied properties. Results suggested that for the sorbents and sorbates studied, the IAST model provided much better results. On average, the IAST model provided lower errors (23%) than the potential model (45%). The effect of competitor structure on the degree of competition was also investigated to identify any relationships between competition and structure using molecular descriptors. The competitors chlorobenzene, naphthalene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene all showed very similar degrees of competition, while benzene, phenanthrene, and pyrene were the least effective competitors toward 12DCB across all sorbents. Different sorption sites or sorption mechanisms might be involved in the sorption of these molecules leading to a lack of competitive behavior. A significant relationship between competitor structure and the degree of competition was observed at environmentally relevant sorbed competitor concentrations for the soil containing the highest fraction of hard carbon (Forbes soil).|1|2010|Environ.

One hallmark of acute inflammation is the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids forming bioactive products that regulate inflammation. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an abundant phagocyte-derived hemoprotein released during phagocyte activation. Here, we investigated the role of MPO in modulating biologically active arachidonic acid (AA) and linoleic acid (LA) metabolites during acute inflammation. Wild-type and MPO-knockout (KO) mice were exposed to intraperitoneally injected endotoxin for 24 h, and plasma LA and AA oxidation products were comprehensively analyzed using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Compared to wild-type mice, MPO-KO mice had significantly lower plasma levels of LA epoxides and corresponding LA- and AA-derived fatty acid diols. AA and LA hydroxy intermediates (hydroxyeicosatetraenoic and hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids) were also significantly lower in MPO-KO mice. Conversely, MPO-deficient mice had significantly higher plasma levels of cysteinyl-leukotrienes with well-known proinflammatory properties. In vitro experiments revealed significantly lower amounts of AA and LA epoxides, LA- and AA-derived fatty acid diols, and AA and LA hydroxy intermediates in stimulated polymorphonuclear neutrophils isolated from MPO-KO mice. Our results demonstrate that MPO modulates the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators during acute inflammation and, in this way, may control acute inflammatory diseases.|Core A|2010|Free Radic.

Modulation of blood oxylipin levels by long-chain omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in hyper- and normolipidemic men|Schuchardt, Jan Philipp; Schmidt, Simone; Kressel, Gaby; Willenberg, Ina; Hammock, Bruce D.; Hahn, Andreas; Schebb, Nils Helge||INTRODUCTION: Long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA) such as EPA and DHA have been shown to possess beneficial health effects, and it is believed that many of their effects are mediated by their oxygenated products (oxylipins). Recently, we have shown that serum levels of several hydroxy, epoxy, and dihydroxy FAs are dependent on the individual status of the parent FAs in a cohort of normo- and hyperlipidemic subjects. So far, the effect of an increased dietary LC n-3 PUFA intake on hydroxy, epoxy, and dihydroxy FA levels has not been investigated in subjects with mild combined hyperlipidemia. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In the present study, we compared oxylipin patterns of 10 hyperlipidemic (cholesterol >200mg/dl; triglyceride >150mg/ml) and 10 normolipidemic men in response to twelve weeks of LC n-3 PUFA intake (1.14g DHA and 1.56g EPA). Levels of 44 free hydroxy, epoxy and dihydroxy FAs were analyzed in serum by LC-MS. Additionally, oxylipin levels were compared with their parent PUFA levels in erythrocyte membranes; a biomarker for the individual PUFA status. RESULTS: Differences in the oxylipin pattern between normo- and hyperlipidemic subjects were minor before and after treatment. In all subjects, levels of EPA-derived oxylipins (170-4800pM) were considerably elevated after LC n-3 PUFA intake (150-1400%), the increase of DHA-derived oxylipins (360-3900pM) was less pronounced (30-130%). The relative change of EPA in erythrocyte membranes is strongly correlated (r≥0.5; p<0.05) with the relative change of corresponding epoxy and dihydroxy FA serum levels. The effect on arachidonic acid (AA)-derived oxylipin levels (140-27,100pM) was inconsistent. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The dietary LC PUFA composition has a direct influence on the endogenous oxylipin profile, including several highly biological active EPA- and DHA-derived lipid mediators. The shift in oxylipin pattern appears to be dependent on the initial LC PUFA status particularly for EPA. The finding that also levels of other oxylipins derived from ALA, LA or AA are modified by LC n-3 PUFA intake might suggest that at least some of the effects of EPA and DHA could be mediated by a shift in the entire oxylipin profile.|5|2014|Prostaglandins Leukot.

Monitoring of total type ii pyrethroid pesticides in citrus oils and water by converting to a common product 3-phenoxybenzoic acid|McCoy, Mark R.; Yang, Zheng; Fu, Xun; Ahn, Ki Chang; Gee, Shirley J.; Bom, David C.; Zhong, Ping; Chang, Dan; Hammock, Bruce D.|Benzoates/analysis/chemistry; Chromatography, Liquid; Citrus/chemistry; Immunoassay; Insecticides/analysis/chemistry; Plant Oils/chemistry; Pyrethrins/analysis/chemistry; Tandem Mass Spectrometry/methods; Water/analysis|Pyrethroids are a class of insecticides that are becoming increasingly popular in agricultural and home use applications. Sensitive assays for pyrethroid insecticides in complex matrices are difficult with both instrumental and immunochemical methods. Environmental analysis of the pyrethroids by immunoassay requires either knowing which pyrethroids contaminate the source or the use of nonspecific antibodies with cross-reactivities to a class of compounds. We describe an alternative method that converts the type II pyrethroids to a common chemical product, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), prior to analysis. This method is much more sensitive than detecting the parent compound, and it is much easier to detect a single compound rather than an entire class of compounds. This is useful in screening for pyrethroids as a class or in situations where a single type of pyrethroid is used. We demonstrated this technique in both citrus oils and environmental water samples with conversion rates of the pyrethroid to 3-PBA that range from 45 to 75% and methods that require no extraction steps for either the immunoassay or the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques. Limits of detection for this technique applied to orange oil are 5 nM, 2 μM, and 0.8 μM when detected by LC-MS/MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and immunoassay, respectively. The limit of detection for pyrethroids in water when detected by immunoassay was 2 nM.|3|2012|J. Agric. Food Chem.

These colorants could dye wool, silk and synthetic fabrics such as polyester and polyacrylic and also show antibacterial properties against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria on the dyed products. Methyl nitrosoguanidine was used as a mutation agent to increase the genetic diversity and the production yield of the bacteria of the family of Vibrio gazogenes. The analysis of the mutated samples showed that two new main colorants as well as three previously found ones were produced. Liquid chromatography electro spray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic techniques were used to elucidate the structures of the newly produced colorants. Mass measurements revealed that the colorants C1, C2, C3, C4 have molecular masses of 321, 323, 351, and 295 Da. One unstable colorant C5 with molecular mass of 309 Da was detected as well. The mutated bacteria strains increased the yield of pigment production by about 81% and produced prodigiosin in 97% purity. The antibiotic activities of pure colorants are discussed as well. Based on their bio-activity and excellent dyeing capabilities, these colorants could be employed in cosmetic and textile industries.|Core A|2010|Biotechnol. Prog.

Protein-bound N-linked glycans were released with peptidyl N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), enriched by graphitized carbon chromatography, and analyzed with Chip-TOF MS. To be defined as N-glycans, compounds were required, in all three procedural replicates, to match, within 6 ppm, against a theoretical human N-glycan library and be at least 2-fold higher in abundance in PNGase F-treated than in control samples. Fifty-two N-linked glycan compositions were identified, and 24 were confirmed via tandem mass spectra analysis. Twenty-seven compositions have been found previously in human milk, and 25 are novel compositions. By abundance, 84% of N-glycans were fucosylated and 47% were sialylated.

NaGdF4:Eu(3+) Nanoparticles for Enhanced X-ray Excited Optical Imaging|Sudheendra, L.; Das, Gautom K.; Li, Changqing; Stark, Daniel; Cena, Jake; Cherry, Simon; Kennedy, Ian M.||X-ray luminescent nanoparticles (NPs), including lanthanide fluorides, have been evaluated for application to deep tissue in vivo molecular imaging using optical tomography. A combination of high material density, higher atomic number and efficient NIR luminescence from compatible lanthanide dopant ions indicates that particles that consist of ALnF4 (A = alkaline, Ln = lanthanide element) may offer a very attractive class of materials for high resolution, deep tissue imaging with X-ray excitation. NaGdF4:Eu(3+) NPs produced an X-ray excited luminescence that was among the most efficient of nanomaterials that have been studied thus far. We have systematically studied factors such as (a) the crystal structure that changes the lattice environment of the doped Eu(3+) ions within the unit cell; and extrinsic factors such as (b) a gold coating (with attendant biocompatibility) that couples to a plasmonic excitation, and (c) changes in the NPs surface properties via changes in the pH of the suspending medium-all with a significant impact on the X-ray excited luminescence of NaGdF4:Eu(3+)NPs. The luminescence from an optimally doped hexagonal phase NaGdF4:Eu(3+) nanoparticle was 25% more intense compared to that of a cubic structure. We observed evidence of plasmonic reabsorption of midwavelength emission by a gold coating on hexagonal NaGdF4:Eu(3+) NPs; fortunately, the NaGdF4:Eu(3+) @Au core-shell NPs retained the efficient (5) D 0 → (7) F 4 NIR (692 nm) luminescence. The NaGdF4:Eu(3+) NPs exhibited sensitivity to the ambient pH when excited by X-rays, an effect not seen with UV excitation. The sensitivity to the local environment can be understood in terms of the sensitivity of the excitons that are generated by the high energy X-rays (and not by UV photons) to crystal structure and to the surface state of the particles.|2|2014|Chem Mater (Chemistry of materials : a publication of the American Chemical Society)||Sudheendra, L.

Nanomolar bifenthrin alters synchronous Ca2+ oscillations and cortical neuron development independent of sodium channel activity|Cao, Zhengyu; Cui, Yanjun; Nguyen, Hai M.; Jenkins, David Paul; Wulff, Heike; Pessah, Isaac N.|Animals; Calcium/metabolism; Cells, Cultured; Cerebral Cortex/cytology; Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism; Insecticides/toxicity; Membrane Potentials/drug effects; Mice; Nerve Net/drug effects/physiology; Neurites/drug effects/physiology; Neurons/drug effects/metabolism; Phosphorylation; Pyrethrins/toxicity; Receptor, Metabotropic Glutamate 5/metabolism; Signal Transduction; Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels/metabolism|Bifenthrin, a relatively stable type I pyrethroid that causes tremors and impairs motor activity in rodents, is broadly used. We investigated whether nanomolar bifenthrin alters synchronous Ca(2+) oscillations (SCOs) necessary for activity-dependent dendritic development. Primary mouse cortical neurons were cultured 8 or 9 days in vitro (DIV), loaded with the Ca(2+) indicator Fluo-4, and imaged using a Fluorescence Imaging Plate Reader Tetra. Acute exposure to bifenthrin rapidly increased the frequency of SCOs by 2.7-fold (EC50 = 58 nM) and decreased SCO amplitude by 36%. Changes in SCO properties were independent of modifications in voltage-gated sodium channels since 100 nM bifenthrin had no effect on the whole-cell Na(+) current, nor did it influence neuronal resting membrane potential. The L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker nifedipine failed to ameliorate bifenthrin-triggered SCO activity. By contrast, the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)5 antagonist MPEP [2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine] normalized bifenthrin-triggered increase in SCO frequency without altering baseline SCO activity, indicating that bifenthrin amplifies mGluR5 signaling independent of Na(+) channel modification. Competitive [AP-5; (-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid] and noncompetitive (dizocilpine, or MK-801 [(5S,10R)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate]) N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonists partially decreased both basal and bifenthrin-triggered SCO frequency increase. Bifenthrin-modified SCO rapidly enhanced the phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Subacute (48 hours) exposure to bifenthrin commencing 2 DIV-enhanced neurite outgrowth and persistently increased SCO frequency and reduced SCO amplitude. Bifenthrin-stimulated neurite outgrowth and CREB phosphorylation were dependent on mGluR5 activity since MPEP normalized both responses. Collectively these data identify a new mechanism by which bifenthrin potently alters Ca(2+) dynamics and Ca(2+)-dependent signaling in cortical neurons that have long term impacts on activity driven neuronal plasticity.|5|2014|Mol.

Nanopeptamers for the development of small-analyte lateral flow tests with a positive readout|Vanrell, Lucía; Gonzalez-Techera, Andrés; Hammock, Bruce D.; Gonzalez-Sapienza, Gualberto||"There is a great demand for rapid tests that can be used on-site for the detection of small analytes, such as pesticides, persistent organic pollutants, explosives, toxins, medicinal and abused drugs, hormones, etc. Dipsticks and lateral flow devices, which are simple and provide a visual readout, may be the answer, but the available technology for these compounds requires a competitive format that loses sensitivity and produces readings inversely proportional to the analyte concentration, which is counterintuitive and may lead to potential misinterpretation of the result. In this work, protein-multipeptide constructs composed of anti-immunocomplex peptides selected from phage libraries and streptavidin/avidin as core protein were used for direct detection of small compounds in a noncompetitive two-site immunoassay format that performs with increased sensitivity and positive readout. These constructs that we termed ""nanopeptamers"" allow the development of rapid point-of-use tests with a positive visual end point of easy interpretation. As proof of concept, lateral flow assays for the herbicides molinate and clomazone were developed and their performance was characterized with field samples."|Core A|2013|Anal. Chem.

Near infrared spectroscopy for determination of various physical, chemical and biochemical properties in Mediterranean soils|Zornoza, R.; Guerrero, C.; Mataix-Solera, J.; Scow, K. M.; Arcenegui, V.; Mataix-Beneyto, J.||The potential of near infrared (NIR) reflectance spectroscopy to predict various physical, chemical and biochemical properties in Mediterranean soils from SE Spain was evaluated. Soil samples (n=393) were obtained by sampling thirteen locations during three years (2003-2005 period). These samples had a wide range of soil characteristics due to variations in land use, vegetation cover and specific climatic conditions. Biochemical properties also included microbial biomarkers based on phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA). Partial least squares (PLS) regression with cross validation was used to establish relationships between the NIR spectra and the reference data from physical, chemical and biochemical analyses. Based on the values of coefficient of determination (r(2)) and the ratio of standard deviation of validation set to root mean square error of cross validation (RPD), predicted results were evaluated as excellent (r(2)>0.90 and RPD>3) for soil organic carbon, Kjeldahl nitrogen, soil moisture, cation exchange capacity, microbial biomass carbon, basal soil respiration, acid phosphatase activity, β-glucosidase activity and PLFA biomarkers for total bacteria, Gram positive bacteria, actinomycetes, vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and total PLFA biomass. Good predictions (0.81<r(2)<0.90 and 2.5<RPD<3) were obtained for exchangeable calcium and magnesium, water soluble carbon, water holding capacity and urease activity. Resultant models for protozoa and fungi were not accurate enough to satisfactorily estimate these variables, only permitting approximate predictions (0.66<r(2)<0.80 and 2.0<RPD<2.5). Electrical conductivity, pH, exchangeable phosphorus and sodium, metabolic quotient and Gram negative bacteria were poorly predicted (r(2)<0.66 and RPD<2). Thus, the results obtained in this study reflect that NIR reflectance spectroscopy could be used as a rapid, inexpensive and non-destructive technique to predict some physical, chemical and biochemical soil properties for Mediterranean soils, including variables related to the composition of the soil microbial community composition.|1|2008|Soil Biol.

Neuronal connectivity as a convergent target of gene × environment interactions that confer risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders|Stamou, Marianna; Streifel, Karin M.; Goines, Paula E.; Lein, Pamela J.||Evidence implicates environmental factors in the pathogenesis of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). However, the identity of specific environmental chemicals that influence ASD risk, severity or treatment outcome remains elusive. The impact of any given environmental exposure likely varies across a population according to individual genetic substrates, and this increases the difficulty of identifying clear associations between exposure and ASD diagnoses. Heritable genetic vulnerabilities may amplify adverse effects triggered by environmental exposures if genetic and environmental factors converge to dysregulate the same signaling systems at critical times of development. Thus, one strategy for identifying environmental risk factors for ASD is to screen for environmental factors that modulate the same signaling pathways as ASD susceptibility genes. Recent advances in defining the molecular and cellular pathology of ASD point to altered patterns of neuronal connectivity in the developing brain as the neurobiological basis of these disorders. Studies of syndromic ASD and rare highly penetrant mutations or CNVs in ASD suggest that ASD risk genes converge on several major signaling pathways linked to altered neuronal connectivity in the developing brain. This review briefly summarizes the evidence implicating dysfunctional signaling via Ca(2+)-dependent mechanisms, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)/phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3K) and neuroligin-neurexin-SHANK as convergent molecular mechanisms in ASD, and then discusses examples of environmental chemicals for which there is emerging evidence of their potential to interfere with normal neuronal connectivity via perturbation of these signaling pathways.|5|2013|Neurotoxicol Teratol (Neurotoxicology and teratology)||Stamou, Streifel, Goines, Lein.

In the present work we measured, comprehensively and systematically, free milk OS in the colostrum of 7 Holstein-Friesian cows during the first 3 d of lactation in 12-h intervals by HPLC-chip/time-of-flight mass spectrometry to determine the biological variation of free milk OS in early lactation. The high sensitivity and resolution of the analytical technique made it possible to monitor all OS species, thus providing a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of OS variations during colostrum production. This study confirmed that although sialyllactose is the major OS in bovine colostrum, several neutral OS species are present in significant abundance even at the third day of lactation. Furthermore, variation in terms of OS species and relative abundances of OS between cows suggest individual animal variation. These variations are likely due to genetic factors because environmental factors such as nutrition, lactation number, and accommodation were the same for all cows. This investigation revealed that colostrum milk from Holstein-Friesian cows is a rich source of neutral and acidic OS for the food and pharmaceutical industries.|Core A|2010|J. Dairy Sci.

New approach to investigate the cytotoxicity of nanomaterials using single cell mechanics|Zimmer, Christopher C.; Liu, Ying X.; Morgan, Joshua T.; Yang, Guohua; Wang, Kang-Hsin; Kennedy, Ian M.; Barakat, Abdul I.; Liu, Gang-Yu||Current in vitro methods to assess nanomaterial cytotoxicity involve various assays to monitor specific cellular dysfunction, such as metabolic imbalance or inflammation. Although high throughput, fast, and animal-free, these in vitro methods suffer from unreliability and lack of relevance to in vivo situations. New approaches, especially with the potential to reliably relate to in vivo studies directly, are in critical need. This work introduces a new approach, single cell mechanics, derived from atomic force microscopy-based single cell compression. The single cell based approach is intrinsically advantageous in terms of being able to directly correlate to in vivo investigations. Its reliability and potential to measure cytotoxicity is evaluated using known systems: zinc oxide (ZnO) and silicon dioxide (SiO2) nanoparticles (NP) on human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). This investigation clearly indicates the reliability of single cell compression. For example, ZnO NPs cause significant changes in force vs relative deformation profiles, whereas SiO2 NPs do not. New insights into NPs-cell interactions pertaining to cytotoxicity are also revealed from this single cell mechanics approach, in addition to a qualitative cytotoxicity conclusion. The advantages and disadvantages of this approach are also compared with conventional cytotoxicity assays.|7|2014|J Phys Chem B (The journal of physical chemistry.

As no experimentally determined structures of the AhR ligand binding domain (LBD) are available and previous homology models were only derived from apo template structures, we developed a new model based on holo X-ray structures of the hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) PAS B domain, targeted to improve the accuracy of the binding site for molecular docking applications. We experimentally confirmed the ability of two HIF-2α crystallographic ligands to bind to the mAhR with relatively high affinity and demonstrated that they are AhR agonists, thus justifying the use of the holo HIF-2α structures as templates. A specific modeling/docking approach was proposed to predict the binding modes of AhR ligands in the modeled LBD. It was validated by comparison of the calculated and the experimental binding affinities of active THS ligands and TCDD for the mAhR and by functional activity analysis using several mAhR mutants generated on the basis of the modeling results. Finally the ability of the proposed approach to reproduce the different affinities of TCDD for AhRs of different species was confirmed, and a first test of its reliability in virtual screening is carried out by analyzing the correlation between the calculated and experimental binding affinities of a set of 14 PCDDs.|5|2011|J Chem Inf Model (Journal of chemical information and modeling)||Motto, Bordogna, Soshilov, Denison, Bonati.

Niemann-pick type C2 deficiency in human fibroblasts confers robust and selective activation of prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis|Frolov, Andrey; Dong, Hua; Jiang, Min; Yang, Lihua; Cook, Erik C.; Matnani, Rahul; Hammock, Bruce D.; Crofford, Leslie J.|Arthritis, Rheumatoid/pathology; Biosynthetic Pathways/drug effects; Carrier Proteins/metabolism; Chromatography, Liquid; Dinoprostone/biosynthesis; Fibroblasts/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism/pathology; Glycoproteins/deficiency/metabolism; Group IV Phospholipases A2/metabolism; Humans; Inflammation/metabolism/pathology; Inflammation Mediators/metabolism; Interleukin-1beta/pharmacology; Intracellular Space/drug effects/metabolism; Microscopy, Confocal; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Protein Transport/drug effects; Signal Transduction/drug effects; Synovial Membrane/pathology; Up-Regulation/drug effects|Activated fibroblasts, also known as myofibroblasts, are mediators of several major human pathologies including proliferative fibrotic disorders, invasive tumor growth, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis. We previously identified Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) protein as a negative regulator of fibroblast activation (Csepeggi, C., Jiang, M., Kojima, F., Crofford, L. J., and Frolov, A. (2011) J. Biol. Chem. 286, 2078-2087). Here we report that NPC2-deficiency leads to a dramatic up-regulation of the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic pathway in human fibroblasts. The major enzymes in this pathway, cPLA2 type IVA, COX-2, and mPGES-1, were dramatically up-regulated at both the transcriptional and translational levels. The specific phenotypic changes resulted in a >10-fold increase in the production and secretion of a key modulator of inflammation and immunity, prostaglandin E2. More importantly, AA metabolome profiling by liquid chromatography/tandem mass-spectrometry revealed the very specific nature of prostaglandin E2 up-regulation as the other analyzed AA metabolites derived from the COX-2, cytochrome P450, 5/15-lipoxygenase, and non-enzymatic oxidative pathways were mostly down-regulated. Blocking activity of cPLA2 efficiently suppressed expression of inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and IL-6, thereby identifying cPLA2 as an important regulator of the inflammatory program in NPC2-null cells. Altogether, these studies highlight NPC2 as a specific regulator of AA metabolism and inflammation that suggests potential for NPC2 protein or its related signaling in the treatment of inflammatory diseases characterized by the presence of activated fibroblasts.|Core A|2013|J.

Nitrate removal, communities of denitrifiers and adverse effects in different carbon substrates for use in denitrification beds|Warneke, Sören; Schipper, Louis A.; Matiasek, Michael G.; Scow, Kate M.; Cameron, Stewart; Bruesewitz, Denise A.; McDonald, Ian R.|Bacteria/drug effects/genetics/growth & development; Carbon/pharmacology; Denitrification/drug effects/genetics; Gene Dosage/genetics; Genes, Bacterial/genetics; Greenhouse Effect; Methane/analysis; Nitrate Reductase/genetics; Nitrates/isolation & purification; Nitrogen/isolation & purification; Nitrous Oxide/analysis; Oxidoreductases/genetics; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/genetics; Solubility/drug effects; Temperature; Water Purification/instrumentation/methods|Denitrification beds are containers filled with wood by-products that serve as a carbon and energy source to denitrifiers, which reduce nitrate (NO(3)(-)) from point source discharges into non-reactive dinitrogen (N(2)) gas. This study investigates a range of alternative carbon sources and determines rates, mechanisms and factors controlling NO(3)(-) removal, denitrifying bacterial community, and the adverse effects of these substrates. Experimental barrels (0.2 m(3)) filled with either maize cobs, wheat straw, green waste, sawdust, pine woodchips or eucalyptus woodchips were incubated at 16.8 °C or 27.1 °C (outlet temperature), and received NO(3)(-) enriched water (14.38 mg N L(-1) and 17.15 mg N L(-1)). After 2.5 years of incubation measurements were made of NO(3)(-)-N removal rates, in vitro denitrification rates (DR), factors limiting denitrification (carbon and nitrate availability, dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, and concentrations of NO(3)(-), nitrite and ammonia), copy number of nitrite reductase (nirS and nirK) and nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) genes, and greenhouse gas production (dissolved nitrous oxide (N(2)O) and methane), and carbon (TOC) loss. Microbial denitrification was the main mechanism for NO(3)(-)-N removal. Nitrate-N removal rates ranged from 1.3 (pine woodchips) to 6.2 g N m(-3) d(-1) (maize cobs), and were predominantly limited by C availability and temperature (Q(10) = 1.2) when NO(3)(-)-N outlet concentrations remained above 1 mg L(-1). The NO(3)(-)-N removal rate did not depend directly on substrate type, but on the quantity of microbially available carbon, which differed between carbon sources. The abundance of denitrifying genes (nirS, nirK and nosZ) was similar in replicate barrels under cold incubation, but varied substantially under warm incubation, and between substrates. Warm incubation enhanced growth of nirS containing bacteria and bacteria that lacked the nosZ gene, potentially explaining the greater N(2)O emission in warmer environments. Maize cob substrate had the highest NO(3)(-)-N removal rate, but adverse effects include TOC release, dissolved N(2)O release and substantial carbon consumption by non-denitrifiers. Woodchips removed less than half of NO(3)(-) removed by maize cobs, but provided ideal conditions for denitrifying bacteria, and adverse effects were not observed. Therefore we recommend the combination of maize cobs and woodchips to enhance NO(3)(-) removal while minimizing adverse effects in denitrification beds.|1|2011|Water Res.

E.|time random-walks; alluvial aquifer system; heterogeneous media; mass-transfer; contaminant transport; geological formations; advection-dispersion; anomalous diffusion; solute transport; exposure-time|We expand the governing equation of groundwater age to account for non-Fickian dispersive fluxes using continuous random walks. Groundwater age is included as an additional (fifth) dimension on which the volumetric mass density of water is distributed and we follow the classical random walk derivation now in five dimensions. The general solution of the random walk recovers the previous conventional model of age when the low-order moments of the transition density functions remain finite at their limits and describes non-Fickian age distributions when the transition densities diverge. Previously published transition densities are then used to show how the added dimension in age affects the governing differential equations. Depending on which transition densities diverge, the resulting models may be nonlocal in time, space, or age and can describe asymptotic or preasymptotic dispersion. A joint distribution function of time and age transitions is developed as a conditional probability and a natural result of this is that time and age must always have identical transition densities. This implies that a transition density defined for age can substitute for a density in time and this has implications for transport model parameter estimation. We present examples of simulated age distributions from a geologically based, heterogeneous domain that exhibit non-Fickian behavior and show that the non-Fickian model provides better descriptions of the distributions than the Fickian model.|1|2012|Water Resour Res (Water Resources Research)||Engdahl, Ginn, Fogg.

Noncompetitive phage anti-immunocomplex real-time polymerase chain reaction for sensitive detection of small molecules|Kim, Hee-Joo; McCoy, Mark; Gee, Shirley J.; González-Sapienza, Gualberto G.; Hammock, Bruce D.|Amino Acid Sequence; Bacteriophage M13; Base Sequence; Benzoates/analysis/metabolism/urine; Humans; Immunoassay/methods; Magnetics; Oligonucleotide Probes/chemistry/genetics; Oligopeptides/chemistry/metabolism; Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods; Pyrethrins/metabolism; Reproducibility of Results; Water/chemistry|Immuno polymerase chain reaction (IPCR) is an analytical technology based on the excellent affinity and specificity of antibodies combined with the powerful signal amplification of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), providing superior sensitivity to classical immunoassays. Here we present a novel type of IPCR termed phage anti-immunocomplex assay real-time PCR (PHAIA-PCR) for the detection of small molecules. Our method utilizes a phage anti-immunocomplex assay (PHAIA) technology in which a short peptide loop displayed on the surface of the M13 bacteriophage binds specifically to the antibody-analyte complex, allowing the noncompetitive detection of small analytes. The phagemid DNA encoding this peptide can be amplified by PCR, and thus, this method eliminates hapten functionalization or bioconjugation of a DNA template while providing improved sensitivity. As a proof of concept, two PHAIA-PCRs were developed for the detection of 3-phenoxybenzoic acid, a major urinary metabolite of some pyrethroid insecticides, and molinate, a herbicide implicated in fish kills. Our results demonstrate that phage DNA can be a versatile material for IPCR development, enabling universal amplification when the common element of the phagemid is targeted or specific amplification when the real time PCR probe is designed to anneal the DNA encoding the peptide. The PHAIA-PCRs proved to be 10-fold more sensitive than conventional PHAIA and significantly faster using magnetic beads for rapid separation of reactants. The assay was validated with both agricultural drain water and human urine samples, showing its robustness for rapid monitoring of human exposure or environmental contamination.|3|2011|Anal. Chem.

Novel 2-amino-isoflavones exhibit aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist or antagonist activity in a species/cell-specific context|Wall, Richard J.; He, Guochun; Denison, Michael S.; Congiu, Cenzo; Onnis, Valentina; Fernandes, Alwyn; Bell, David R.; Rose, Martin; Rowlands, J.

Activation of the AhR occurs through binding to a group of structurally diverse compounds, most notably dioxins, which are exogenous ligands. Isoflavones are part of a family which include some well characterised endogenous AhR ligands. This paper analysed a novel family of these compounds, based on the structure of 2-amino-isoflavone. Initially two luciferase-based cell models, mouse H1L6.1c2 and human HG2L6.1c3, were used to identify whether the compounds had AhR agonistic and/or antagonistic properties. This analysis showed that some of the compounds were weak agonists in mouse and antagonists in human. Further analysis of two of the compounds, Chr-13 and Chr-19, was conducted using quantitative real-time PCR in rat H4IIE and human MCF-7 cells. The results indicated that Chr-13 was an agonist in rat but an antagonist in human cells. Chr-19 was shown to be an agonist in rat but more interestingly, a partial agonist in human. Luciferase induction results not only revealed that subtle differences in the structure of the compound could produce species-specific differences in response but also dictated the ability of the compound to be an AhR agonist or antagonist. Substituted 2-amino-isoflavones represent a novel group of AhR ligands that must differentially interact with the AhR ligand binding domain to produce their species-specific agonist or antagonist activity and future ligand binding analysis and docking studies with these compounds may provide insights into the differential mechanisms of action of structurally similar compounds.|5|2012|Toxicology (Toxicology)||Wall, He, Denison, Congiu, Onnis, Fernandes, Bell, Rose, Rowlands, Balboni, Mellor.

Novel sorafenib-based structural analogues: in-vitro anticancer evaluation of t-MTUCB and t-AUCMB|Wecksler, Aaron T.; Hwang, Sung Hee; Wettersten, Hiromi I.; Gilda, Jennifer E.; Patton, Amy; Leon, Leonardo J.; Carraway, Kermit L.; Gomes, Aldrin V.; Baar, Keith; Weiss, Robert H.; Hammock, Bruce D.||In the current work, we carried out a mechanistic study on the cytotoxicity of two compounds, trans-4-[4-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-cyclohexyloxy]-N-methyl-benzamide (t-AUCMB) and trans-N-methyl-4-{4-[3-(4-trifluoromethoxy-phenyl)-ureido]-cyclohexyloxy}-benzamide (t-MTUCB), that are structurally similar to sorafenib. These compounds show strong cytotoxic responses in various cancer cell lines, despite significant differences in the induction of apoptotic events such as caspase activation and lactate dehydrogenase release in hepatoma cells. Both compounds induce autophagosome formation and LC3I cleavage, but there was little observable effect on mTORC1 or the downstream targets, S6K1 and 4E-binding protein. In addition, there was an increase in the activity of upstream signaling through the IRS1/PI3K/Akt-signaling pathway, suggesting that, unlike sorafenib, both compounds induce mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-independent autophagy. The autophagy observed correlates with mitochondrial membrane depolarization, apoptosis-inducing factor release, and oxidative stress-induced glutathione depletion. However, there were no observable changes in the endoplasmic reticulum-stress markers such as binding immunoglobulin protein, inositol-requiring enzyme-α, phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2, and the lipid peroxidation marker, 4-hydroxynonenal, suggesting endoplasmic reticulum-independent oxidative stress. Finally, these compounds do not have the multikinase inhibitory activity of sorafenib, which may be reflected in their difference in the ability to halt cell cycle progression compared with sorafenib. Our findings indicate that both compounds have anticancer effects comparable with sorafenib in multiple cell lines, but they induce significant differences in apoptotic responses and appear to induce mTOR-independent autophagy. t-AUCMB and t-MTUCB represent novel chemical probes that are capable of inducing mTOR-independent autophagy and apoptosis to differing degrees, and may thus be potential tools for further understanding the link between these two cellular stress responses.|5|2014|Anticancer Drugs (Anti-cancer drugs)||Wecksler, Hwang, Wettersten, Gilda, Patton, Leon, Carraway, Gomes, Baar, Weiss, Hammock.

Nucleotide Specificity of DNA Binding of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor:ARNT Complex Is Unaffected by Ligand Structure|DeGroot, Danica E.; Denison, Michael S.||The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates the toxic and biological effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD, dioxin) and a wide variety of structurally diverse ligands through its ability to translocate into the nucleus and bind to a specific DNA recognition site (the dioxin-responsive element [DRE]) adjacent to responsive genes. Although the sequence of the DRE is well defined, several reports suggested that the nucleotide specificity of AhR DNA binding may vary depending on the structure of its bound ligand. Given the potential toxicological significance of this hypothesis, an unbiased DNA-selection-and-PCR-amplification approach was utilized to directly determine whether binding and activation of the AhR by structurally diverse agonists alter its nucleotide specificity of DNA binding. Guinea pig hepatic cytosolic AhR activated in vitro by equipotent concentrations of TCDD, 3-methylcholanthrene, β-naphthoflavone, indirubin, L-kynurenine, or YH439 was incubated with a pool of DNA oligonucleotides containing a 15-base pair variable region consisting of all possible nucleotides. The AhR-bound oligonucleotides isolated by immunoprecipitation were PCR amplified and used in subsequent rounds of selection. Sequence analysis of a total of 196 isolated oligonucleotides revealed that each ligand-activated AhR:ARNT complex only bound to DRE-containing DNA oligonucleotides; no non-DRE-containing DNA oligonucleotides were identified. These results demonstrate that the binding and activation of the AhR by structurally diverse agonists do not appear to alter its nucleotide specificity of DNA binding and suggest that stimulation of gene expression mediated by direct DNA binding of ligand-activated AhR:ARNT complexes is DRE dependent.|5|2014|Toxicol.

Steps to increase the nutritional quality of individual foods will assist in personalizing health and in guiding individuals to achieve superior health. Nutrigenomics is the scientific field of the genetic basis for varying susceptibilities to disease and the diverse responses to foods. Although some of these genetic determinants will be simple and amenable to personal genotyping as the means to predict health, in practice most will not. As a result, genotyping will not be the secret to personalizing diet and health. Human assessment technologies from imaging to proteomics and metabolomics are providing tools to both understand and accurately assess the nutritional phenotype of individuals.

Nutritional lipidomics: Molecular metabolism, analytics, and diagnostics|Smilowitz, Jennifer T.; Zivkovic, Angela M.; Wan, Yu-Jui Yvonne; Watkins, Steve M.; Nording, Malin L.; Hammock, Bruce D.; German, J. Bruce||The field of lipidomics is providing nutritional science a more comprehensive view of lipid intermediates. Lipidomics research takes advantage of the increase in accuracy and sensitivity of mass detection of MS with new bioinformatics toolsets to characterize the structures and abundances of complex lipids. Yet, translating lipidomics to practice via nutritional interventions is still in its infancy. No single instrumentation platform is able to solve the varying analytical challenges of the different molecular lipid species. Biochemical pathways of lipid metabolism remain incomplete and the tools to map lipid compositional data to pathways are still being assembled. Biology itself is dauntingly complex and simply separating biological structures remains a key challenge to lipidomics. Nonetheless, the strategy of combining tandem analytical methods to perform the sensitive, high-throughput, quantitative, and comprehensive analysis of lipid metabolites of very large numbers of molecules is poised to drive the field forward rapidly. Among the next steps for nutrition to understand the changes in structures, compositions, and function of lipid biomolecules in response to diet is to describe their distribution within discrete functional compartments lipoproteins. Additionally, lipidomics must tackle the task of assigning the functions of lipids as signaling molecules, nutrient sensors, and intermediates of metabolic pathways.|Core A|2013|Mol Nutr Food Res (Molecular nutrition & food research)||Smilowitz, Zivkovic, Wan, Watkins, Nording, Hammock, German.

It is dominated by neutrophils and their proteolytic and oxidative products and includes a wide spectrum of bioactive lipids produced by both host and presumably microbial metabolic pathways.

On dithiothreitol (DTT) as a measure of oxidative potential for ambient particles: evidence for the importance of soluble transition metals|Charrier, J. G.; Anastasio, C.||The rate of consumption of dithiothreitol (DTT) is increasingly used to measure the oxidative potential of particulate matter (PM), which has been linked to the adverse health effects of PM. While several quinones are known to be very reactive in the DTT assay, it is unclear what other chemical species might contribute to the loss of DTT in PM extracts. To address this question, we quantify the rate of DTT loss from individual redox-active species that are common in ambient particulate matter. While most past research has indicated that the DTT assay is not sensitive to metals, our results show that seven out of the ten transition metals tested do oxidize DTT, as do three out of the five quinones tested. While metals are less efficient at oxidizing DTT compared to the most reactive quinones, concentrations of soluble transition metals in fine particulate matter are generally much higher than those of quinones. The net result is that metals appear to dominate the DTT response for typical ambient PM(2.5) samples. Based on particulate concentrations of quinones and soluble metals from the literature, and our measured DTT responses for these species, we estimate that for typical PM(2.5) samples approximately 80 % of DTT loss is from transition metals (especially copper and manganese), while quinones account for approximately 20 %. We find a similar result for DTT loss measured in a small set of PM(2.5) samples from the San Joaquin Valley of California. Because of the important contribution from metals, we also tested how the DTT assay is affected by EDTA, a chelator that is sometimes used in the assay. EDTA significantly suppresses the response from both metals and quinones; we therefore recommend that EDTA should not be included in the DTT assay.|7|2012|Atmos Chem Phys (Atmospheric chemistry and physics (Print))||Charrier, Anastasio.

Opposing actions of insulin and arsenite converge on PKCdelta to alter keratinocyte proliferative potential and differentiation|Reznikova, Tatiana V.; Phillips, Marjorie A.; Patterson, Timothy J.; Rice, Robert H.|Arsenites/pharmacology; Cell Differentiation/drug effects; Cell Line, Transformed; Cell Proliferation/drug effects; Cell Size/drug effects; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents/pharmacology; Insulin/pharmacology; Keratinocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism; Protein Kinase C-delta/metabolism; RNA, Messenger/analysis; Signal Transduction/physiology|When cultured human keratinocytes reach confluence, they undergo a program of changes replicating features of differentiation in vivo, including exit from the proliferative pool, increased cell size, and expression of specialized differentiation marker proteins. Previously, we showed that insulin is required for some of these steps and that arsenite, a human carcinogen in skin and other epithelia, opposes the differentiation process. In present work, we show that insulin signaling, probably through the IGF-I receptor, is required for the increase in cell size accompanying differentiation and that this is opposed by arsenite. We further examine the impact of insulin and arsenite on PKCdelta, a known key regulator of keratinocyte differentiation, and show that insulin increases the amount, tyrosine phosphorylation, and membrane localization of PKCdelta. All these effects are prevented by exposure of cells to arsenite or to inhibitors of downstream effectors of insulin (phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin). Retrovirally mediated expression of activated PKCdelta resulted in increased loss of proliferative potential after confluence and greatly increased formation of cross-linked envelopes, a marker of keratinocyte terminal differentiation. These effects were prevented by removal of insulin, but not by arsenite addition. We further demonstrate a role for src family kinases in regulation of PKCdelta. Finally, inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor kinase activity diminished the ability of arsenite to prevent cell enlargement and to suppress insulin-dependent PKCdelta amount and tyrosine 311 phosphorylation. Thus suppression of PKCdelta signaling is a critical feature of arsenite action in preventing keratinocyte differentiation and maintaining proliferative capability.|5|2010|Mol. Carcinog.

To identify proteome adaptations supporting cell function and survival in such a harsh environment we compared the proteome of a) the hyperosmotic renal papilla with that of adjacent iso-osmotic cortex tissue and b) the renal papilla of diuretic versus that of anti-diuretic mice. Though functionally distinct the papilla is in close physical proximity to the renal cortex, an iso-osmotic region. Proteomic differences between the papilla and cortex of C57BL6 mice were identified using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. We found 37 different proteins characteristic of the cortex and 16 proteins over-represented in the papilla. Regional specificity was confirmed by Western blot and further substantiated by immunohistochemistry for selected proteins. Proteins that are characteristic of the renal papilla include αB crystallin, Hsp beta-1, Hsp90, 14-3-3 protein, glutathione S-transferase, aldose reductase, actin and tropomyosin. Gene ontology analysis confirmed a significant increase in molecular functions associated with protein chaperoning and cell stabilization. Proteins over-represented in the cortex were largely related to routine metabolism. During antidiuresis 15 different proteins changed significantly while 18 different proteins changed significantly during diuresis relative to normally hydrated controls. Changes were confirmed by Western blot for selected proteins. Proteins that are significantly altered by diuretic state are associated with cell structure (actin, tubulin), signaling (Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor, abhydrolase domain-containing protein 14B), chaperone functioning (Hsp beta-1, αB crystallin, T complex protein-1) and anti-oxidant functions (α-enolase, GAPDH and LDH). Taken together our study reveals that specific proteins involved in protein folding, cytoskeletal stabilization, antioxidant responses, and stress signaling contribute greatly to the unique hyperosmotic stress resistant phenotype of the kidney papilla.|Core B|2011|Biochim.

Para- and ortho-substitutions are key determinants of polybrominated diphenyl ether activity toward ryanodine receptors and neurotoxicity|Kim, Kyung Ho; Bose, Diptiman D.; Ghogha, Atefeh; Riehl, Joyce; Zhang, Rui; Barnhart, Christopher D.; Lein, Pamela J.; Pessah, Isaac N.|Animals; Calcium/metabolism; Calcium Signaling/drug effects; Cell Line; Environmental Pollutants/chemistry/metabolism/toxicity; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers/chemistry/metabolism/toxicity; Humans; Nervous System/drug effects/metabolism; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel/metabolism; Structure-Activity Relationship|BACKGROUND: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widely used flame retardants that bioaccumulate in human tissues. Their neurotoxicity involves dysregulation of calcium ion (Ca(2+))signaling; however, specific mechanisms have yet to be defined. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to define the structure-activity relationship (SAR) for PBDEs and their metabolites toward ryanodine receptors type 1 (RyR1) and type 2 (RyR2) and to determine whether it predicts neurotoxicity. METHODS: We analyzed [3H]ryanodine binding, microsomal Ca(2+) fluxes, cellular measurements of Ca(2+) homeostasis, and neurotoxicity to define mechanisms and specificity of PBDE-mediated Ca(2+) dysregulation. RESULTS: PBDEs possessing two ortho-bromine substituents and lacking at least one para-bromine substituent (e.g., BDE-49) activate RyR1 and RyR2 with greater efficacy than corresponding congeners with two para-bromine substitutions (e.g., BDE-47). Addition of a methoxy group in the free para position reduces the activity of parent PBDEs. The hydroxylated BDEs 6-OH-BDE-47 and 4´-OH-BDE-49 are biphasic RyR modulators. Pretreatment of HEK293 cells (derived from human embryonic kidney cells) expressing either RyR1 or RyR2 with BDE-49 (250 nM) sensitized Ca2+ flux triggered by RyR agonists, whereas BDE-47 (250 nM) had negligible activity. The divergent activity of BDE-49, BDE-47, and 6-OH-BDE-47 toward RyRs predicted neurotoxicity in cultures of cortical neurons. CONCLUSIONS: We found that PBDEs are potent modulators of RyR1 and RyR2. A stringent SAR at the ortho and para position determined whether a congener enhanced, inhibited, or exerted nonmonotonic actions toward RyRs. These results identify a convergent molecular target of PBDEs previously identified for noncoplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that predicts their cellular neurotoxicity and therefore could be a useful tool in risk assessment of PBDEs and related compounds.|5|2011|Environ.

PCB 136 Atropselectively Alters Morphometric and Functional Parameters of Neuronal Connectivity in Cultured Rat Hippocampal Neurons via Ryanodine Receptor-Dependent Mechanisms|Yang, Dongren; Kania-Korwel, Izabela; Ghogha, Atefeh; Chen, Hao; Stamou, Marianna; Bose, Diptiman D.; Pessah, Isaac N.; Lehmler, Hans-Joachim; Lein, Pamela J.||We recently demonstrated that polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners with multiple ortho chlorine substitutions sensitize ryanodine receptors (RyR), and this activity promotes Ca(2+)-dependent dendritic growth in cultured neurons. Many ortho-substituted congeners display axial chirality and we previously reported that the chiral congener PCB 136 (2,2',3,3',6,6'-hexachlorobiphenyl) atropselectively sensitizes RyRs. Here, we test the hypothesis that PCB 136 atropisomers differentially alter dendritic growth and other parameters of neuronal connectivity influenced by RyR activity. (-)-PCB 136, which potently sensitizes RyRs, enhances dendritic growth in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons, whereas (+)-PCB 136, which lacks RyR activity, has no effect on dendritic growth. The dendrite promoting activity of (-)-PCB 136 is observed at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 nM, and is blocked by pharmacologic RyR antagonism. Neither atropisomer alters axonal growth or cell viability. Quantification of PCB 136 atropisomers in hippocampal cultures indicates that atropselective effects r on dendritic growth are not due to differential partitioning of atropisomers into cultured cells. Imaging of hippocampal neurons loaded with Ca(2+)-sensitive dye demonstrates that (-)-PCB 136 but not (+)-PCB 136 increases the frequency of spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations. Similarly, (-)-PCB 136 but not (+)-PCB 136 increases the activity of hippocampal neurons plated on microelectrode arrays. These data support the hypothesis that atropselective effects on RyR activity translate into atropselective effects of PCB 136 atropisomers on neuronal connectivity, and suggest that the variable atropisomeric enrichment of chiral PCBs observed in the human population may be a significant determinant of individual susceptibility for adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes following PCB exposure.|5|2014|Toxicol.

PCB-95 modulates the calcium-dependent signaling pathway responsible for activity-dependent dendritic growth|Wayman, Gary A.; Bose, Diptiman D.; Yang, Dongren; Lesiak, Adam; Bruun, Donald; Impey, Soren; Ledoux, Veronica; Pessah, Isaac N.; Lein, Pamela J.|Animals; Calcium/metabolism; Cells, Cultured; Dendrites/drug effects; Hippocampus/cytology; Neurons/drug effects/metabolism; Polychlorinated Biphenyls/toxicity; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Signal Transduction/drug effects|BACKGROUND: Non-dioxin-like (NDL) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) promote dendritic growth in hippocampal neurons via ryanodine receptor (RyR)-dependent mechanisms; however, downstream signaling events that link enhanced RyR activity to dendritic growth are unknown. Activity-dependent dendritic growth, which is a critical determinant of neuronal connectivity in the developing brain, is mediated by calcium ion (Ca(2+))-dependent activation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase-I (CaMKI), which triggers cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-dependent Wnt2 transcription. RyRs regulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of intracellular Ca(2+) signals, but whether RyRs promote dendritic growth via modulation of this signaling pathway is not known. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that the CaMKI-CREB-Wnt2 signaling pathway couples NDL PCB-enhanced RyR activity to dendritic arborization. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ca(2+) imaging of dissociated cultures of primary rat hippocampal neurons indicated that PCB-95 (2,2',3,5'6-pentachlorobiphenyl; a potent RyR potentiator), enhanced synchronized Ca(2+) oscillations in somata and dendrites that were blocked by ryanodine. As determined by Western blotting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, PCB-95 also activated CREB and up-regulated Wnt2. Blocking CaMKK, CaMKIα/γ, MEK/ERK, CREB, or Wnt2 prevented PCB-95-induced dendritic growth. Antagonism of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors with bicuculline (BIC) phenocopied the dendrite-promoting effects of PCB-95, and pharmacological antagonism or siRNA knockdown of RyR blocked BIC-induced dendritic growth in dissociated and slice cultures of hippocampal neurons. CONCLUSIONS: RyR activity contributes to dynamic remodeling of dendritic architecture in response to NDL PCBs via CaMKI-CREB-Wnt2 signaling in rats. Our findings identify PCBs as candidate environmental risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders, especially in children with heritable deficits in calcium signaling associated with autism.|5|2012|Environ.

PCB-95 promotes dendritic growth via ryanodine receptor-dependent mechanisms|Wayman, Gary A.; Yang, Dongren; Bose, Diptiman D.; Lesiak, Adam; Ledoux, Veronica; Bruun, Donald; Pessah, Isaac N.; Lein, Pamela J.|Animals; Cells, Cultured; Dendrites/drug effects; Hippocampus/cytology; Neurons/drug effects/metabolism; Polychlorinated Biphenyls/toxicity; Rats; Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel/genetics/metabolism|BACKGROUND: Aroclor 1254 (A1254) interferes with normal dendritic growth and plasticity in the developing rodent brain, but the mechanism(s) mediating this effect have yet to be established. Non-dioxin-like (NDL) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) enhance the activity of ryanodine receptor (RyR) calcium ion (Ca(2+)) channels, which play a central role in regulating the spatiotemporal dynamics of intracellular Ca(2+) signaling. Ca(2+) signaling is a predominant factor in shaping dendritic arbors, but whether PCB potentiation of RyR activity influences dendritic growth is not known. OBJECTIVE: We determined whether RyR activity is required for PCB effects on dendritic growth. METHODS AND RESULTS: Golgi analysis of hippocampi from weanling rats confirmed that developmental exposure via the maternal diet to NDL PCB-95 (2,2',3,5'6-pentachlorobiphenyl), a potent RyR potentiator, phenocopies the dendrite-promoting effects of A1254. Dendritic growth in dissociated cultures of primary hippocampal neurons and in hippocampal slice cultures is similarly enhanced by PCB-95 but not by PCB-66 (2,3,4',4-tetrachlorobiphenyl), a congener with negligible effects on RyR activity. The dendrite-promoting effects of PCB-95 are evident at concentrations as low as 2 pM and are inhibited by either pharmacologic blockade or siRNA knockdown of RyRs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that environmentally relevant levels of NDL PCBs modulate neuronal connectivity via RyR-dependent effects on dendritic arborization. In addition, these findings identify RyR channel dysregulation as a novel mechanism contributing to dysmorphic dendritogenesis associated with heritable and environmentally triggered neurodevelopmental disorders.|5|2012|Environ.

PCBs contamination in seafood species at the Eastern Coast of Thailand|Jaikanlaya, Chate; Settachan, Daam; Denison, Michael S.; Ruchirawat, Mathuros; van den Berg, Martin|Animals; Bivalvia/chemistry; Food Contamination/analysis; Ostreidae/chemistry; Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis/toxicity; Principal Component Analysis; Seafood; Shellfish/analysis; Thailand|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a large group of persistent organic substances spread throughout the world. The most toxic PCBs are those that are dioxin-like (dl-PCBs). Environmental studies on PCBs in Thailand are limited, especially with regards to dl-PCBs. This study is one of the first in this country that demonstrates contamination of seafood with PCBs and determines the levels of PCBs and total dioxin like activity in mussels, oysters and shrimp, from the Eastern Coast of Thailand. Sixty pooled samples of mussels and twenty-seven pooled samples of oysters were collected from cultivation farms and twenty-one pooled samples of shrimp were collected from fisherman piers. Qualitative and quantitative measurements of 49 PCB congeners was obtained by HRGC-ECD analysis and total dioxin-like activity using the CAFLUX bioassay. Total PCB concentrations varied between three species, ranging between 19 and 1100 ng g(-1) lipid adjusted weight, and the levels of PCBs in shrimp was three time higher than that in mussels and oysters. With respected to the pattern of PCB congeners, it implied that the source of PCBs exposure in this area could be from the regional contamination. The calculated CAFLUX bioanalytical equivalents (BEQs) values ranged between 0.8 and 18 pg BEQ g(-1) lipid adjusted weight, and showed a good relationship with the chemical-derived TEQs. Therefore, the CAFLUX bioassay can be used for effective screening of dioxin-like activity in marine species effectively.|5|2009|Chemosphere (Chemosphere)||Jaikanlaya, Settachan, Denison, Ruchirawat, van den Berg.

Pelargonidin activates the AhR and induces CYP1A1 in primary human hepatocytes and human cancer cell lines HepG2 and LS174T|Kamenickova, Alzbeta; Anzenbacherova, Eva; Pavek, Petr; Soshilov, Anatoly A.; Denison, Michael S.; Anzenbacher, Pavel; Dvorak, Zdenek|0 (AHR protein, human); 0 (Anthocyanins); 0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors); 0 (Ligands); 0 (RNA, Messenger); 0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon); 1746-01-6 (Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin); 7690-51-9 (pelargonidin); EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP1A1 protein, human); EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1); Anthocyanins/*pharmacology; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*drug effects/metabolism; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/*biosynthesis; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Enzyme Induction; Hep G2 Cells; Hepatocytes/*drug effects/enzymology; Humans; Intestinal Neoplasms/enzymology; Kinetics; Ligands; Liver Neoplasms/*enzymology; Microsomes, Liver/enzymology; Primary Cell Culture; Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects; RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/*drug effects/metabolism; Signal Transduction/drug effects; Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin/pharmacology; Transcriptional Activation/drug effects; Transfection|We examined the effects of anthocyanidins (cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, peonidin, petunidin, pelargonidin) on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-CYP1A1 signaling pathway in human hepatocytes, hepatic HepG2 and intestinal LS174T cancer cells. AhR-dependent reporter gene expression in transfected HepG2 cells was increased by pelargonidin in a concentration-dependent manner at 24h. Similarly, pelargonidin induced the expression of CYP1A1 mRNA up to 5-fold in HepG2 and LS174T cells relative to the induction by 5 nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), the most potent activator of AhR. CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs were also increased by pelargonidin in three primary human hepatocytes cultures (approximately 5% of TCDD potency) and the increase in CYP1A1 protein in HepG2 and LS174T cells was comparable to the increase in catalytic activity of CYP1A1 enzyme. Ligand binding analysis demonstrated that pelargonidin was a weak ligand of AhR. Enzyme kinetic analyses using human liver microsomes revealed inhibition of CYP1A1 activity by delphinidin (IC50 78 muM) and pelargonidin (IC50 33 muM). Overall, although most anthocyanidins had no effects on AhR-CYP1A1 signaling, pelargonidin can bind to and activate the AhR and AhR-dependent gene expression, and pelargonidin and delphinidin inhibit the CYP1A1 catalytic activity.|5|2013|Toxicol Lett (Toxicology letters)||Kamenickova, Anzenbacherova, Pavek, Soshilov, Denison, Anzenbacher, Dvorak.

Perinatal exposure to environmental polychlorinated biphenyls sensitizes hippocampus to excitotoxicity ex vivo|Kim, Kyung Ho; Pessah, Isaac N.|Animals; Chlorodiphenyl (54% Chlorine)/toxicity; Electric Stimulation; Environmental Pollutants/toxicity; Evoked Potentials/drug effects; Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials/drug effects; Female; GABA-A Receptor Antagonists/toxicity; Hippocampus/drug effects/embryology/growth & development; Maternal Exposure; Neuronal Plasticity/drug effects; Picrotoxin/toxicity; Polychlorinated Biphenyls/toxicity; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Risk Assessment; Synaptic Transmission/drug effects; Time Factors|Ortho-substituted polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a concern to human developmental health. Rat dams were exposed to an environmentally relevant mixture of PCBs, Aroclor 1254, or pure congener PCB 95 (6 mg/kg/day) during the perinatal period (GD 5 through PD 21). Hippocampal slices prepared from offspring 1-3 weeks post-weaning were tested for persisting changes in sensitivity to the excitotoxicant picrotoxin. Hippocampal slices were placed on multielectrode arrays. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded from Schaffer Collateral/Commissural fibers in striatum radiatum of the CA1 region in response to single pulse stimuli. After recording baseline excitability, GABA(A) receptors were blocked by inclusion of picrotoxin (100 μM) in the aCSF perfusate. Picrotoxin produced negligible changes in fEPSP slope in slices isolated from offspring exposed to vehicle, whereas slices from either PCB test group invariably showed >200% (p<0.01) synaptic facilitation. Picrotoxin produced prominent after-discharges (epileptic wave forms) in the evoked potentials measured from PCB exposed, but not control, hippocampal slices. These results show that developmental exposure to non-coplanar PCBs is sufficient to produce changes in synaptic plasticity that can be unmasked in the presence of GABA(A) receptor deficits that persist 1-3 weeks after exposure ceased. Developmental exposure to PCBs may sensitize seizure susceptibility postnatally, especially in susceptible populations with GABA(A) receptor signaling deficits.|5|2011|Neurotoxicology (Neurotoxicology)||Kim, Pessah.

Phage anti-immune complex assay: general strategy for noncompetitive immunodetection of small molecules|González-Techera, A.; Vanrell, L.; Last, J. A.; Hammock, B. D.; González-Sapienza, G.|Antigen-Antibody Complex/analysis/immunology; Binding, Competitive; Immunoassay/methods; Molecular Sequence Data; Molecular Structure; Peptide Library; Peptides/chemistry/isolation & purification; Sensitivity and Specificity|Due to their size, small molecules cannot be simultaneously bound by two antibodies, precluding their detection by noncompetitive two-site immunoassays, which are superior to competitive ones in terms of sensitivity, kinetics, and working range. This has prompted the development of anti-immune complex antibodies, but these are difficult to produce, and often exhibit high cross-reactivity with the unliganded primary antibody. This work demonstrates that anti-immune complex antibodies can be substituted by phage particles isolated from phage display peptide libraries. Phages bearing specific small peptide loops allowed to focus the recognition to changes in the binding area of the immune complex. The concept was tested using environmental and drug analytes; with improved sensitivity and ready adaptation into on-site formats. Peptides specific for different immune complexes can be isolated from different peptide libraries in a simple and systematic fashion allowing the rapid development of noncompetitive assays for small molecules.|3|2007|Anal.

The sensitivity attained with the PHAIA format was over 10 times higher than that of the competitive format. The cross-reactivity of the two methods was also compared using structurally related compounds, and we observed that the two-site binding of PHAIA ""double-checks"" the recognition of the analyte, thereby increasing the assay specificity. The positive readout of the noncompetitive PHAIA method allowed adaptation of the assay into a rapid and simple format where as little as 0.4 ng/mL clomazone (more than 10-fold lower than the proposed standard) in water samples from a rice field could be easily detected by simple visual inspection."|3|2010|Anal.

Phage-Displayed Peptide That Mimics Aflatoxins and Its Application in Immunoassay|Wang, Yanru; Wang, Hong; Li, Peiwu; Zhang, Qi; Kim, Hee Joo; Gee, Shirley J.; Hammock, Bruce D.||To search for an alternative to using protein conjugated aflatoxin as a coating antigen in aflatoxin detection by an ELISA method, a random-8-peptide library was constructed and used as a source of peptides that mimic aflatoxins (termed as mimotopes). Five mimotope peptides were obtained by panning-elution from the library and were successfully used in an indirect competitive ELISA for analyzing total aflatoxin concentration. The assay exhibited an IC(50) value of 14 μg/kg in samples (with 1 in 7 dilution of sample extract) for aflatoxins. The linear range is 4-24 μg/kg. Further validation indicated relatively good recovery (60-120%) in peanut, rice and corn. Natural contaminated samples (peanut and feedstuff) were analyzed for aflatoxin concentration by both conventional ELISA and phage ELISA. The results showed good correlation. It can be concluded that the mimotope preparation is an effective substitute for the aflatoxin based coating antigen in ELISA and can be used in real sample analysis.|3|2013|J. Agric. Food Chem.

Pharmacokinetic optimization of four soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors for use in a murine model of inflammation|Liu, Jun-Yan; Tsai, Hsing-Ju; Hwang, Sung Hee; Jones, Paul D.; Morisseau, Christophe; Hammock, Bruce D.|Administration, Oral; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Area Under Curve; Benzoates/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use; Biological Availability; Disease Models, Animal; Epoxide Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors; Inflammation/drug therapy/metabolism; Injections, Intravenous; Injections, Subcutaneous; Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Models, Biological; Solubility; Urea/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors (sEHIs) such as 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-dodecanoic acid (AUDA) are effective anti-hypertensive and anti-inflammatory agents in various animal models. However, their poor metabolic stability and limited water solubility make them difficult to use pharmacologically. Here we present the evaluation of four sEHIs for improved pharmacokinetic properties and the anti-inflammatory effects of one sEHI. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The pharmacokinetic profiles of inhibitors were determined following p.o. (oral) administration and serial bleeding in mice. Subsequently the pharmacokinetics of trans-4-[4-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-cyclohexyloxy]-benzoic acid (t-AUCB), the most promising inhibitor, was further studied following s.c. (subcutaneous), i.v. (intravenous) injections and administration in drinking water. Finally, the anti-inflammatory effect of t-AUCB was evaluated by using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated murine model. KEY RESULTS: Better pharmacokinetic parameters (higher C(max), longer t(1/2) and greater AUC) were obtained from the tested inhibitors, compared with AUDA. Oral bioavailability of t-AUCB (0.1 mg.kg(-1)) was 68 +/- 22% (n = 4), and giving t-AUCB in drinking water is recommended as a feasible, effective and easy route of administration for chronic studies. Finally, t-AUCB (p.o.) reversed the decrease in plasma ratio of lipid epoxides to corresponding diols (a biomarker of soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibition) in lipopolysaccharide-treated mice. The in vivo potency of 1 mg.kg(-1) of t-AUCB (p.o.) was better in this inflammatory model than that of 10 mg.kg(-1) of AUDA-butyl ester (p.o) at 6 h after treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: t-AUCB is a potent sEHI with improved pharmacokinetic properties.

Therefore, sEH has emerged as a therapeutic target for treating various cardiovascular diseases and inflammatory pain. N,N'-Disubstituted ureas are potent sEH inhibitors in vitro. However, in vivo usage of early sEH inhibitors has been limited by their low bioavailability and poor physiochemical properties. Therefore, a group of highly potent compounds with more drug-like physiochemical properties were evaluated by monitoring their plasma profiles in dogs treated orally with sEH inhibitors. Urea compounds with an adamantyl or a 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl group on one side and a piperidyl or a cyclohexyl ether group on the other side of the urea function showed pharmacokinetic profiles with high plasma concentrations and long half lives. In particular, the inhibitor trans-4-[4-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-cyclohexyloxy]-benzoic acid (t-AUCB) not only is very potent with good physiochemical properties, but also shows high oral bioavailability for doses ranging from 0.01 to 1mg/kg. This compound is also very potent against the sEH of several mammals, suggesting that t-AUCB will be an excellent tool to evaluate the biology of sEH in multiple animal models. Such compounds may also be a valuable lead for the development of veterinary therapeutics.|Core A|2010|Eur J Pharm Sci (European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences)||Tsai, Hwang, Morisseau, Yang, Jones, Kasagami, Kim, Hammock.

The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics in terms of inhibitory potency of sEHIs were assessed in non-human primates (NHPs). Development of a sEHI for use in NHPs will facilitate investigations on the role of sEH in numerous chronic inflammatory conditions. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: PK parameters of 11 sEHIs in cynomolgus monkeys were determined after oral dosing with 0.3 mg·kg(-1). Their physical properties and inhibitory potency in hepatic cytosol of cynomolgus monkeys were examined. Dose-dependent effects of the two inhibitors 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl) urea (TPPU) and the related acetyl piperidine derivative, 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-acetylpiperidin-4-yl) urea (TPAU), on natural blood eicosanoids, were determined. KEY RESULTS: Among the inhibitors tested, TPPU and two 4-(cyclohexyloxy) benzoic acid urea sEHIs displayed high plasma concentrations (>10 × IC(50)), when dosed orally at 0.3 mg·kg(-1). Although the 4-(cyclohexyloxy) benzoic acid ureas were more potent against monkey sEH than piperidyl ureas (TPAU and TPPU), the latter compounds showed higher plasma concentrations and more drug-like properties. The C(max) increased with dose from 0.3 to 3 mg·kg(-1) for TPPU and from 0.1 to 3 mg·kg(-1) for TPAU, although it was not linear over this range of doses. As an indication of target engagement, ratios of linoleate epoxides to diols increased with TPPU administration.

Photonic Crystal Lab-On-a-Chip for Detecting Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B at Low Attomolar Concentration|Han, Jin-Hee; Kim, Hee-Joo; Sudheendra, L.; Gee, Shirley J.; Hammock, Bruce D.; Kennedy, Ian M.||"Nanoscale wells have been fabricated in a chip to construct a photonic crystal that is used for enhanced immunoassays of a common food-borne toxin, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). The nanostructure of the photonic crystal (PC) in the array enhanced the fluorescent signal due to a guided mode resonance. Nanoparticles were used as the solid substrate for attachment of capture antibodies; the particles were then isolated in individual wells of the chip by using an electrophoretic particle entrapment system (EPES). The standard curve generated from the chip consisted of two log-linear regions: the first region with a greater sensitivity, limited by the Kd of the antibody, resembling the 96-well plate ELISA and the other that shows greater than six orders of linearity extending to attomolar concentrations, which is unique to the device we have developed. SEB dissolved in phosphate buffered saline was resolved to levels as low as 35 aM with 10(6)-fold better limit of detection than a conventional 96-well-ELISA.

Photonic Crystal Lab-On-a-Chip for Detecting Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B at Low Attomolar Concentration|Han, Jin-Hee; Kim, Hee-Joo; Sudheendra, L.; Gee, Shirley J.; Hammock, Bruce D.; Kennedy, Ian M.||"Nanoscale wells have been fabricated in a chip to construct a photonic crystal that is used for enhanced immunoassays of a common food-borne toxin, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). The nanostructure of the photonic crystal (PC) in the array enhanced the fluorescent signal due to a guided mode resonance. Nanoparticles were used as the solid substrate for attachment of capture antibodies; the particles were then isolated in individual wells of the chip by using an electrophoretic particle entrapment system (EPES). The standard curve generated from the chip consisted of two log-linear regions: the first region with a greater sensitivity, limited by the Kd of the antibody, resembling the 96-well plate ELISA and the other that shows greater than six orders of linearity extending to attomolar concentrations, which is unique to the device we have developed. SEB dissolved in phosphate buffered saline was resolved to levels as low as 35 aM with 10(6)-fold better limit of detection than a conventional 96-well-ELISA. Different concentrations of SEB spiked into milk were tested to assess the reliability of the device and the efficacy of the extended log-linear regime in a ""real"" food matrix. The presence of the milk did not significantly alter the limit of detection.

Phototransformation rate constants of PAHs associated with soot particles|Kim, Daekyun; Young, Thomas M.; Anastasio, Cort||Photodegradation is a key process governing the residence time and fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in particles, both in the atmosphere and after deposition. We have measured photodegradation rate constants of PAHs in bulk deposits of soot particles illuminated with simulated sunlight. The photodegradation rate constants at the surface (k(p)(0)), the effective diffusion coefficients (D(eff)), and the light penetration depths (z(0.5)) for PAHs on soot layers of variable thickness were determined by fitting experimental data with a model of coupled photolysis and diffusion. The overall disappearance rates of irradiated low molecular weight PAHs (with 2-3 rings) on soot particles were influenced by fast photodegradation and fast diffusion kinetics, while those of high molecular weight PAHs (with 4 or more rings) were apparently controlled by either the combination of slow photodegradation and slow diffusion kinetics or by very slow diffusion kinetics alone. The value of z(0.5) is more sensitive to the soot layer thickness than the k(p)(0) value. As the thickness of the soot layer increases, the z(0.5) values increase, but the k(p)(0) values are almost constant. The effective diffusion coefficients calculated from dark experiments are generally higher than those from the model fitting method for illumination experiments. Due to the correlation between k(p)(0) and z(0.5) in thinner layers, D(eff) should be estimated by an independent method for better accuracy. Despite some limitations of the model used in this study, the fitted parameters were useful for describing empirical results of photodegradation of soot-associated PAHs.|1|2013|Sci. Total Environ.

Plasmonic enhanced emissions from cubic NaYF(4):Yb: Er/Tm nanophosphors|Sudheendra, L.; Ortalan, Volkan; Dey, Sanchita; Browning, Nigel D.; Kennedy, I. M.||A metal shell was used in this study to provide significant enhancement of the up-converted emission from cubic NaYF(4) nanoparticles, creating a valuable composite material for labeling in biology and other applications - use of the cubic form of the material obviates the need to undertake a high temperature transformation to the naturally more efficient hexagonal phase. The NaYF(4) matrix contained ytterbium sensitizer and an Erbium (Er) or Thulium (Tm) activator. The particle sizes of the as-synthesized nanoparticles were in the range of 20-40 nm with a gold shell thickness of 4-8 nm. The gold shell was macroscopically amorphous. The synthesis method was based on a citrate chelation. In this approach, we exploited the ability of the citrate ion to act as a reductant and stabilizer. Confining the citrate ion reductant on the nanophosphor surface rather than in the solution was critical to the gold shell formation. The plasmonic shell enhanced the up-conversion emission of Tm from visible and near-infrared regions by up to a factor of 8, in addition to imparting a visible color arising from the plasmon absorption of the gold shell. The up-conversion enhancement observed with Tm and Er were different for similar gold coverages, with local crystal field changes as a possible route to enhance up-conversion emission from high symmetry structural hosts. These novel up-converting nanophosphor particles combine the phosphor and features of a gold shell, providing a unique platform for many biological imaging and labeling applications.|2|2011|Chem Mater (Chemistry of materials : a publication of the American Chemical Society)||Sudheendra, Ortalan, Dey, Browning, Kennedy.

Predicted transport of pyrethroid insecticides from an urban landscape to surface water|Jorgenson, Brant; Fleishman, Erica; Macneale, Kate H.; Schlenk, Daniel; Scholz, Nathaniel L.; Spromberg, Julann A.; Werner, Inge; Weston, Donald P.; Xiao, Qingfu; Young, Thomas M.; Zhang, Minghua|California; Environmental Monitoring/methods; Insecticides/analysis/toxicity; Nitriles/analysis/toxicity; Pyrethrins/analysis/toxicity; Rivers/chemistry; Water Movements; Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis/toxicity|The authors developed a simple screening-level model of exposure of aquatic species to pyrethroid insecticides for the lower American River watershed (California, USA). The model incorporated both empirically derived washoff functions based on existing, small-scale precipitation simulations and empirical data on pyrethroid insecticide use and watershed properties for Sacramento County, California, USA. The authors calibrated the model to in-stream monitoring data and used it to predict daily river pyrethroid concentration from 1995 through 2010. The model predicted a marked increase in pyrethroid toxic units starting in 2000, coincident with an observed watershed-wide increase in pyrethroid use. After 2000, approximately 70% of the predicted total toxic unit exposure in the watershed was associated with the pyrethroids bifenthrin and cyfluthrin. Pyrethroid applications for aboveground structural pest control on the basis of suspension concentrate categorized product formulations accounted for greater than 97% of the predicted total toxic unit exposure. Projected application of mitigation strategies, such as curtailment of structural perimeter band and barrier treatments as recently adopted by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation, reduced predicted total toxic unit exposure by 84%. The model also predicted that similar reductions in surface-water concentrations of pyrethroids could be achieved through a switch from suspension concentrate-categorized products to emulsifiable concentrate-categorized products without restrictions on current-use practice. Even with these mitigation actions, the predicted concentration of some pyrethroids would continue to exceed chronic aquatic life criteria.|1|2013|Environ. Toxicol. Chem.

Preparation of 20-HETE using multifunctional enzyme type 2-negative Starmerella bombicola|van Bogaert, Inge; Zhang, Guodong; Yang, Jun; Liu, Jun-Yan; Ye, Yonghao; Soetaert, Wim; Hammock, Bruce D.||The metabolism of arachidonic acid (ARA) by cytochrome P450 ω/ω-1-hydroxylases leads to the formation of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), which is an important lipid-signaling molecule involved in regulation of vascular tone, angiogenesis, and inflammation. Development of a simple method to prepare 20-HETE would greatly facilitate the investigation of its biological activities. The nonpathogenic yeast Starmerella bombicola has been shown to convert exogenously added arachidonic acid to 20-HETE via the biosynthetic pathway of sophorolipids; however, the yield was low. Here we demonstrate that genetic knockout of multifunctional enzyme type 2 (MFE-2), which is involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids, significantly increases the yield of ARA conversion to 20-HETE and allows practical preparation of 20-HETE.|Core A|2013|J.

Many conventional approaches have used Proteobacteria-based primers to detect nosZ in environmental samples. However, these primers often fail to detect nosZ in non-Proteobacteria strains, including Firmicutes (Gram-positive) and Bacteroidetes. In this study, newly designed nosZ primers successfully amplified this gene from five Geobacillus species (Firmicutes). The primers were used to construct nosZ clone libraries from DNA extracted from sludge and domestic animal feedlot soils, all with high organic carbon contents. After DNA sequencing, phylogenetic analysis identified many new nosZ sequences with high levels of homology to nosZ from Bacteroidetes, probably because of the high sequence similarity of nosZ from Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and a predominance of Bacteroidetes in feedlot environments. Three sets of new quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) primers based on our clone library sequences were designed and tested for their specificities. Our data showed that only Bacteroidetes-related nosZ sequences were amplified, whereas conventional Proteobacteria-based primers amplified only Proteobacteria-related nosZ. Quantitative analysis of nosZ with the new qPCR primers recovered ~10(4) copies per 100 ng DNA. Thus, it appears that amplification with conventional primers is insufficient for developing an understanding of the diversity and abundance of nosZ genes in the environment.|1|2013|Microbiology (Microbiology (Reading, England))||Jung, Choi, Jung, Scow, Park.

Profiling the regulatory lipids: another systemic way to unveil the biological mystery|Yang, Jun; Dong, Hua; Hammock, Bruce D.|Animals; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods/standards; Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors/adverse effects; Drug Evaluation/methods; Eicosanoids/metabolism; Fatty Acids, Omega-3/metabolism; Humans; Lactones/adverse effects; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Metabolomics/methods; Sulfones/adverse effects; Tandem Mass Spectrometry/methods/standards|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The regulatory lipids are a class of bioactive lipids which regulate various important biological processes. Profiling these regulatory lipids is an attractive method to understand the role of these metabolites. This is especially true because most of these regulatory lipids are derived from several important pharmacological targets: cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, and cytochrome P450 enzymes. This review highlights the development of methods to profile these regulatory lipids and the recent publications employing these profiling methods. RECENT FINDINGS: The recent development of methods for the profiling of regulatory lipids target two different directions: to expand coverage for discovery studies (fingerprinting) and to make the quantitative method more accurate, sensitive, and faster for diagnostic or more detailed studies. Recent applications of these profiling methods including assessment of in-vivo drug engagement, pathways crosstalk, and possible mechanisms for side-effects of a withdrawn anti-inflammatory drug rofecoxib are also reviewed here. SUMMARY: The profiling of regulatory lipids is a useful tool for many investigations. The breadth of coverage, throughput limits with detection, and reproducibility of quantitation are being improved. The resulting data will assist with fundamental investigation, disease biomarker discovery, drug discovery, and drug development.|Core A|2011|Curr. Opin. Lipidol.

Progress in the development of biosensors for environmental and human monitoring of agrochemicals|Kim, Hee-Joo; Gee, Shirley J.; Li, Qing X.; Hammock, Bruce D.||A sensitive, automated, non-competitive fluorescent immunoassay was developed for quantitative analysis of 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (PBA) in human urine samples as a putative biomarker of exposure to pyrethroid insecticides using the bench top immunoanalyzer, KinExATM 3000 system. The key difference between the KinExA system and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is to eliminate the PBA-antibody interaction with the coating antigen. This can be achieved by separately capturing the free PBA-antibody onto the hapten-immobilized beads when a constant amount of reaction solution in equilibrium between PBA-antibody and analyte passes through the bead-packed glass capillary column. Optimal dilution of the PBA antibody was determined when fluorescent signals of 0.5-2 were obtained and a sufficient amount of coating antigen was immobilized to ensure the capture of all free antibodies. IC50s of the two KinExA methods (0.3 and 0.6 ng/mL for one- and two-step KinExA, respectively) were 3- and 6-fold better than the heterologous ELISA and were approximately 650- and 300-fold lower compared to that of the homologous ELISA (IC50 of 200 ng/mL). The KinExA assay was negligibly affected within tested range of pHs (5-10) and ionic strengths (1, 5, and 10X PBS). Similar urine matrix effects were observed in the two KinExA assays with a 5- to 10-fold increase in IC50s when 5 and 10% of urine was contained in the reaction buffer. A high correlation (r2 = 0.99) was observed between detected and spiked concentrations of PBA standard with average recoveries of 88-160%.|3|2007|Rational Environmental Management of Agrochemicals: Risk Assessment, Monitoring, and Remedial Action||Kim, Gee, Li, Hammock.

Protection from hypertension in mice by the Mediterranean diet is mediated by nitro fatty acid inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase|Charles, Rebecca L.; Rudyk, Olena; Prysyazhna, Oleksandra; Kamynina, Alisa; Yang, Jun; Morisseau, Christophe; Hammock, Bruce D.; Freeman, Bruce A.; Eaton, Philip||Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is inhibited by electrophilic lipids by their adduction to Cys521 proximal to its catalytic center. This inhibition prevents hydrolysis of the enzymes' epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) substrates, so they accumulate inducing vasodilation to lower blood pressure (BP). We generated a Cys521Ser sEH redox-dead knockin (KI) mouse model that was resistant to this mode of inhibition. The electrophilic lipid 10-nitro-oleic acid (NO2-OA) inhibited hydrolase activity and also lowered BP in an angiotensin II-induced hypertension model in wild-type (WT) but not KI mice. Furthermore, EET/dihydroxy-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid isomer ratios were elevated in plasma from WT but not KI mice following NO2-OA treatment, consistent with the redox-dead mutant being resistant to inhibition by lipid electrophiles. sEH was inhibited in WT mice fed linoleic acid and nitrite, key constituents of the Mediterranean diet that elevates electrophilic nitro fatty acid levels, whereas KIs were unaffected. These observations reveal that lipid electrophiles such as NO2-OA mediate antihypertensive signaling actions by inhibiting sEH and suggest a mechanism accounting for protection from hypertension afforded by the Mediterranean diet.|5|2014|Proc.

NA results in acute cytotoxicity to respiratory epithelium in rodents. Cytochrome P450-dependent metabolic activation to form reactive intermediates and loss of soluble cellular thiols (glutathione) are critical steps in NA toxicity, but the precise mechanisms by which this chemical results in cellular injury remain unclear. Protein thiols are likely targets of reactive NA metabolites. Loss of these, through adduction or thiol oxidation mechanisms, may be important underlying mechanisms for NA toxicity. To address the hypothesis that loss of thiols on specific cellular proteins is critical to NA-induced cytotoxicity, we compared reduced to oxidized thiol ratios in airway epithelial cell proteins isolated from lungs of mice treated with NA or the nontoxic glutathione depletor, diethyl maleate (DEM). At 300 mg/kg doses, NA administration resulted in a greater than 85% loss of glutathione levels in the airway epithelium, which is similar to the loss observed after DEM treatment. Using differential fluorescent maleimide labeling followed by 2DE separation of proteins, we identified more than 35 unique proteins that have treatment-specific differential sulfhydryl oxidation. At doses of NA and DEM that produce similar levels of glutathione depletion, Cy3/Cy5 labeling ratios were statistically different for 16 nonredundant proteins in airway epithelium. Proteins identified include a zinc finger protein, several aldehyde dehydrogenase variants, beta-actin, and several other structural proteins. These studies show distinct patterns of protein thiol alterations with the noncytotoxic DEM and the cytotoxic NA.|4|2010|Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol.

Proteomic analysis of hair shaft and nail plate|Rice, Robert H.|Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation/physiology; Hair/physiology; Humans; Nails/physiology; Proteomics|The protein components of living cells in the hair follicle are amenable to study by standard molecular biological techniques, but identifying those in the hair shaft has been problematic until recently. Most of the protein, primarily keratins and keratin associated proteins, can be extracted under denaturing conditions, but 15-20% is intractable due to transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking. Shotgun proteomics now permits identifying >300 constituents of the isopeptide cross-linked proteome and even certain post-translational modifications. The proteins originate from all the intracellular compartments, indicating that the cross-linking process makes effective use of available resources to produce structures with great mechanical stability. Knowing this proteome provides a foundation for correlating defects in hair shaft structure with protein deficiencies. Such investigations can be extended to mouse models of aberrant pelage hair. Thus, inbred mouse strains can be distinguished by their hair proteomes, raising the possibility of similar variation in the human population. The nail plate is also amenable to this shotgun proteomic approach. Providing discrete and noninvasive sampling of the human proteome, these epidermal appendages could have diagnostic utility for certain disease states.|5|2011|J Cosmet Sci (Journal of cosmetic science)||Rice.

Proteomic Analysis of Human Keratinocyte Response to 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin (TCDD) Exposure|Hu, Qin; Rice, Robert H.; Qin, Qin; Phinney, Brett S.; Eigenheer, Richard A.; Bao, Wenjun; Zhao, Bin||Chronic exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibeno-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related polyhalogenated organic pollutants occurs as a consequence of modern life. Exploring the cellular basis for their action is anticipated to help understand the risk they pose and improve the foundation for their regulation. A basis for the striking change in human keratinocyte colony morphology due to TCDD exposure has been investigated by shotgun proteomics. Concentrating on changes in protein levels among three cell strains has revealed significant decreases in the differentiation markers filaggrin, keratin 1, and keratin 10. EGF treatment in concert with TCDD enhanced the changes in these markers and several other proteins while reducing the levels of certain other proteins. The only protein stimulated by TCDD in all three strains and reversed by EGF in them was vimentin, not previously observed to be in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor response domain. Although TCDD is often proposed to enhance keratinocyte differentiation, proteomic analysis reveals it uncouples the differentiation program and suggests that reduced levels of differentiation marker proteins contribute to the observed excessive stratification it induces.|5|2013|J.

Keratins comprised a majority of the detergent-insoluble fraction as well, but numerous cytoplasmic, membrane, and junctional proteins and histones were also identified, indicating broad use by transglutaminases of available proteins as substrates for cross-linking. Two novel membrane proteins were identified, also found in the hair shaft, for which mRNAs were detected only at very low levels by real-time polymerase chain reaction in other tissues. Parallel analyses of nail samples from volunteers from Inner Mongolia, China gave essentially the same protein profiles. Comparison of the profiles of nail plate and hair shaft from the latter volunteers revealed extensive overlap of protein constituents.

Pyrethroid sorption to Sacramento River suspended solids and bed sediments|Fojut, T. L.; Young, T. M.|Adsorption; California; Geologic Sediments/*chemistry; Insecticides/*chemistry; Kinetics; Pyrethrins/*chemistry; Rivers/*chemistry; Waste Disposal, Fluid|Sorption of pyrethroid insecticides to solid materials will typically dominate the fate and transport of these hydrophobic compounds in aquatic environments. Batch reactor isotherm experiments were performed with bifenthrin and lambda-cyhalothrin with suspended material and bed sediment collected from the Sacramento River, California, USA. These batch reactor experiments were performed with low spiking concentrations and a long equilibration time (28 d) to be more relevant to environmental conditions. Sorption to suspended material and bed sediment was compared to examine the role of differential sorption between these phases in the environmental transport of pyrethroids. The equilibrium sorption data were fit to the Freundlich isotherm model and fit with r(2) > 0.87 for all experiments. Freundlich exponents ranged from 0.72 +/- 0.19 to 1.07 +/- 0.050, indicating sorption nonlinearity for some of the experimental conditions and linearity for others over the concentration range tested. The Freundlich capacity factors were larger for the suspended solids than for the bed sediments, and the suspended material had a higher specific surface area and higher organic carbon content compared to the bed sediment. Calculated organic carbon-normalized distribution coefficients were larger than those previously reported in the literature, by approximately an order of magnitude, and ranged from 10(6.16) to 10(6.68) at an equilibrium aqueous concentration of 0.1 microg/L. Higher than expected sorption of pyrethroids to the tested materials may be explained by sorption to black carbon and/or mineral surfaces.|1|2011|Environmental toxicology and chemistry / SETAC (Environ Toxicol Chem)||Fojut, Young.

Pyrethroids in house dust from the homes of farm worker families in the MICASA study|Trunnelle, Kelly J.; Bennett, Deborah H.; Tancredi, Daniel J.; Gee, Shirley J.; Stoecklin-Marois, Maria T.; Hennessy-Burt, Tamara E.; Hammock, Bruce D.; Schenker, Marc B.|Adolescent; Adult; Agriculture/statistics & numerical data; California; Demography; Dust/analysis; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Humans; Male; Mexican Americans/statistics & numerical data; Middle Aged; Pesticides/analysis; Pyrethrins/analysis; Questionnaires; Young Adult|Indoor pesticide exposure is a growing concern, particularly for pyrethroids, a commonly used class of pesticides. Pyrethroid concentrations may be especially high in homes of immigrant farm worker families, who often live in close proximity to agricultural fields and are faced with poor housing conditions, potentially causing high pest infestation and pesticide use. We investigate levels of pyrethroids in the house dust of farm worker family homes in a study of mothers and children living in Mendota, CA, within the population-based Mexican Immigration to California: Agricultural Safety and Acculturation (MICASA) Study. We present pesticide use data and levels of pyrethroid pesticides in indoor dust collected in 2009 as measured by questionnaires and a GC/MS analysis of the pyrethroids cis- and trans-permethrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate and resmethrin in single dust samples collected from 55 households. Cis- and trans-permethrin had the highest detection frequencies at 67%, with median concentrations of 244 and 172ng/g dust, respectively. Cypermethrin was detected in 52% of the homes and had a median concentration of 186ng/g dust. Esfenvalerate, resmethrin and deltamethrin were detected in less than half the samples. We compared the pyrethroid concentrations found in our study to other studies looking at both rural and urban homes and daycares. Lower detection frequencies and/or lower median concentrations of cis- and trans-permethrin and cypermethrin were observed in our study as compared to those studies. However, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate and resmethrin were detected more frequently in the house dust from our study than in the other studies. Because households whose children had higher urinary pyrethroid metabolite levels were more likely to be analyzed in this study, a positive bias in our estimates of household pyrethroid levels may be expected. A positive association was observed with reported outdoor pesticide use and cypermethrin levels found in the indoor dust samples (rs=0.28, p=0.0450). There was also a positive association seen with summed pyrethroid levels in house dust and the results of a pesticide inventory conducted by field staff (rs=0.32, p=0.018), a potentially useful predictor of pesticide exposure in farm worker family homes.

Pyrethroids in house dust from the homes of farm worker families in the MICASA study|Trunnelle, Kelly J.; Bennett, Deborah H.; Tancredi, Daniel J.; Gee, Shirley J.; Stoecklin-Marois, Maria T.; Hennessy-Burt, Tamara E.; Hammock, Bruce D.; Schenker, Marc B.|Adolescent; Adult; Agriculture/statistics & numerical data; California; Demography; Dust/analysis; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Humans; Male; Mexican Americans/statistics & numerical data; Middle Aged; Pesticides/analysis; Pyrethrins/analysis; Questionnaires; Young Adult|Indoor pesticide exposure is a growing concern, particularly for pyrethroids, a commonly used class of pesticides. Pyrethroid concentrations may be especially high in homes of immigrant farm worker families, who often live in close proximity to agricultural fields and are faced with poor housing conditions, potentially causing high pest infestation and pesticide use. We investigate levels of pyrethroids in the house dust of farm worker family homes in a study of mothers and children living in Mendota, CA, within the population-based Mexican Immigration to California: Agricultural Safety and Acculturation (MICASA) Study. We present pesticide use data and levels of pyrethroid pesticides in indoor dust collected in 2009 as measured by questionnaires and a GC/MS analysis of the pyrethroids cis- and trans-permethrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate and resmethrin in single dust samples collected from 55 households. Cis- and trans-permethrin had the highest detection frequencies at 67%, with median concentrations of 244 and 172ng/g dust, respectively. Cypermethrin was detected in 52% of the homes and had a median concentration of 186ng/g dust. Esfenvalerate, resmethrin and deltamethrin were detected in less than half the samples. We compared the pyrethroid concentrations found in our study to other studies looking at both rural and urban homes and daycares. Lower detection frequencies and/or lower median concentrations of cis- and trans-permethrin and cypermethrin were observed in our study as compared to those studies. However, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate and resmethrin were detected more frequently in the house dust from our study than in the other studies. Because households whose children had higher urinary pyrethroid metabolite levels were more likely to be analyzed in this study, a positive bias in our estimates of household pyrethroid levels may be expected. A positive association was observed with reported outdoor pesticide use and cypermethrin levels found in the indoor dust samples (rs=0.28, p=0.0450). There was also a positive association seen with summed pyrethroid levels in house dust and the results of a pesticide inventory conducted by field staff (rs=0.32, p=0.018), a potentially useful predictor of pesticide exposure in farm worker family homes. Further research is warranted to fully investigate the utility of such a measure.|Core A|2013|Environ Int (Environment international)||Trunnelle, Bennett, Tancredi, Gee, Stoecklin-Marois, Hennessy-Burt, Hammock, Schenker.

Al, Cr, Fe, Se, and Sn all exhibited columnless attenuation, which indicated unintended interactions with system components. Based on signal-to-noise ratio and peak reproducibility between duplicate analyses of environmental samples, consistent peak time and height were observed for Mg, Cl, Mn, Cu, Br, and Pb. Al, V, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Se, Cd, Sn, and Sb were less consistent overall, but produced consistent measurements in select samples. Ultrafiltering and centrifuging produced similar peak distributions, but glass fiber filtration produced more high molecular weight (MW) peaks.

In this study, a method for the separate analysis of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs (dl-PCBs) in human serum with the new sensitive H1L7.5c1 mouse hepatoma cell line was optimized. Sample dilution factors of 5 and 2.4 were selected for routine analysis of respectively the PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs. The validation studies showed that repeatability and within-lab reproducibility for the quality control (QC) standard were within the in-house criteria. A long-term within-lab reproducibility of 25% for the PCDD/F fraction and 41% for the dl-PCB fraction for the analysis of pooled serum samples, expressed as pg BEQ/g fat, was determined. CALUX recoveries of the spiked procedural blanks were within the acceptable in-house limits of 80-120% for both fractions and the LOQ was 30.3 pg BEQ/g fat for the PCDD/Fs and 14.5 pg BEQ/g fat for the dl-PCBs. The GC-HRMS recovery of a C13-spiked pooled serum sample was between 60 and 90% for all PCDD/F congeners and between 67 and 82% for the non-ortho PCBs. An adequate separation between both fractions was found. The CALUX/GC-HRMS ratio for a pooled serum sample was respectively 2.0 and 1.4 for the PCDD/Fs and the dl-PCBs, indicating the presence of additional AhR active compounds. As expected, a correlation was found between human serum samples analyzed with both the new H1L7.5c1 cell line and the more established H1L6.1c3 cell line. The geometric mean CALUX-BEQ values, reported for the adolescents of the second Flemish Environment and Health Study (FLEHS II) recruited in 2009-2010, were 108 (95% CI: 101-114) pg CALUX-BEQ/g fat for the PCDD/Fs and 32.1 (30.1-34.2) pg CALUX-BEQ/g fat for the dioxin-like PCBs.|5|2011|Talanta (Talanta)||Croes, van Langenhove, Den Hond, Bruckers, Colles, Koppen, Loots, Nelen, Schoeters, Nawrot, van Larebeke, Denison, Vandermarken, Elskens, Baeyens.

Assessment of oxidized fatty acid levels is important for understanding their homeostatic and pathophysiological roles. Most reported methods examine these pathways in isolation. The work described here employed a solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization MS/MS (SPE-LC-ESI MS/MS) method to monitor these metabolites. In 21 min, 39 oxylipins were quantified along with eight corresponding internal standards. The limits of quantification were between 0.07 and 32 pg (20 pM-10 nM). Finally, the validated method was used to evaluate oxylipin profiles in lipopolysaccharide-exposed mice, an established septic inflammatory model. The method described here offers a useful tool for the evaluation of complex regulatory oxylipin responses in in vitro or in vivo studies.|Core A|2009|Anal. Chem.

For over a century, these biochemical transformations have been the target of numerous pharmacological drugs for inflammation and pain. In particular, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitors (coxibs) are widely used in the treatment of inflammation and pain. However, gastrointestinal (GI) and cardiovascular adverse effects of NSAIDs and coxibs, and recent findings demonstrating that there are significant risks from the disruption of oxylipin levels when pharmacologically inhibiting a single ARA cascade metabolic pathway, have led to studies involving the simultaneous inhibition of multiple pathways in ARA cascade. These studies suggest that multitarget inhibition represents a new and valuable option to enhance efficacy or reduce side-effects in the treatment of inflammation and pain. This review focuses on the crosstalk within the three pathways of the ARA cascade (cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP450)), and summarizes the current and future approaches of multitarget inhibitors for the treatment of eicosanoid driven inflammation and pain.|Core A|2013|Curr.

Reactivity versus steric effects in fluorinated ketones as esterase inhibitors: a quantum mechanical and molecular dynamics study|Rayo, Josep; Muñoz, Lourdes; Rosell, Gloria; Hammock, Bruce D.; Guerrero, Angel; Luque, F.

One of the most potent inhibitors both for mammalian and insect CEs are trifluoromethyl ketones (TFMKs), but the mechanism of action of these chemicals is not completely understood. This study examines the balance between reactivity versus steric effects in modulating the activity against human carboxylesterase 1. The intrinsic reactivity of the ketone moiety is determined from quantum mechanical computations, which combine gas phase B3LYP calculations with hydration free energies estimated with the IEF/MST model. In addition, docking and molecular dynamics simulations are used to explore the binding mode of the inhibitors along the deep gorge that delineates the binding site. The results point out that the activity largely depends on the nature of the fluorinated ketone, since the activity is modulated by the balance between the intrinsic electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon atom and the ratio between keto and hydrate forms. However, the results also suggest that the correct alignment of the alkyl chain in the binding site can exert a large influence on the inhibitory activity, as this effect seems to override the intrinsic reactivity features of the fluorinated ketone. Overall, the results sustain a subtle balance between reactivity and steric effects in modulating the inhibitory activity of TFMK inhibitors.|Core A|2010|J Mol Model (Journal of molecular modeling)||Rayo, Muñoz, Rosell, Hammock, Guerrero, Luque, Pouplana.

Reduction of inflammatory bowel disease-induced tumor development in IL-10 knockout mice with soluble epoxide hydrolase gene deficiency|Zhang, Wanying; Liao, Jie; Li, Haonan; Dong, Hua; Bai, Han; Yang, Allison; Hammock, Bruce D.; Yang, Guang-Yu||Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) quickly inactivates anti-inflammatory epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) by converting them to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs). Inhibition of sEH has shown effects against inflammation, but little is studied about the role of sEH in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its induced carcinogenesis. In the present study, the effect of sEH gene deficiency on the development of IBD-induced tumor development was determined in IL-10 knockout mice combined with sEH gene deficiency. Tumor development in the bowel was examined at the age of 25 wk for male mice and 35 wk for female mice. Compared to IL-10(-/-) mice, sEH (-/-)/IL-10(-/-) mice exhibited a significant decrease of tumor multiplicity (2 ± 0.9 tumors/mouse vs. 1 ± 0.3 tumors/mouse) and tumor size (344.55 ± 71.73 mm(3) vs. 126.94 ± 23.18 mm(3) ), as well as a marked decrease of precancerous dysplasia. The significantly lower inflammatory scores were further observed in the bowel in sEH(-/-)/IL-10(-/-) mice as compared to IL-10(-/-) mice, including parameters of inflammation-involved area (0.70 ± 0.16 vs. 1.4 ± 0.18), inflammation cell infiltration (1.55 ± 0.35 vs. 2.15 ± 0.18), and epithelial hyperplasia (0.95 ± 0.21 vs. 1.45 ± 0.18), as well as larger ulcer formation. qPCR and Western blotting assays demonstrated a significant downregulation of cytokines/chemokines (TNF-α, MCP-1, and IL-12, 17, and 23) and NF-κB signals. Eicosanoid acid metabolic profiling revealed a significant increase of ratios of EETs to DHETs and EpOMEs to DiOMEs. These results indicate that sEH plays an important role in IBD and its-induced carcinogenesis and could serve as a highly potential target of chemoprevention and treatment for IBD. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.|Core A|2012|Mol.

Concern is mounting about the negative effects of environmental estrogens on fish reproduction; however, in environmental mixtures, the affects from estrogenic compounds may be suppressed by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands. Indeed, reductions in 17beta-estradiol-induced (0.01 and 1 mg/kg) vitellogenin (VTG) levels were observed in white sturgeon coinjected with beta-naphthoflavone (BNF; 50 mg/kg), a model for contaminants that activate the AhR. Variation in the time of injection was used to attempt to correlate VTG inhibition to ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity. No evidence was found to suggest that the inhibition of VTG is a direct result of enhanced estrogen metabolism by BNF-induced enzymes. Results of the present study are relevant for monitoring programs that measure VTG, because these results show that AhR-active environmental contaminants can repress VTG synthesis, which commonly is used as an indicator of estrogen-mimicking contaminants. Furthermore, suppression of natural estrogen signaling by AhR agonists may have significant effects on fish reproduction.|5|2009|Environ. Toxicol. Chem.

The plume persisted until 2010 despite excavation of the tanks and piping within months after the spill and excavations of additional contaminated sediments from the source area in 2007 and 2008. The probable history of MTBE concentrations along the plume centerline at its source was estimated using a wide variety of available information, including published details about the original spill, excavations and monitoring by VAFB consultants, and our own research data. Two-dimensional reactive transport simulations of MTBE along the plume centerline were conducted for a 20-year period following the spill. These analyses suggest that MTBE diffused from the thin anaerobic aquifer into the adjacent anaerobic silts and transformed to TBA in both aquifer and silt layers. The model reproduces the observation that after 2004 TBA was the dominant solute, diffusing back out of the silts into the aquifer and sustaining plume concentrations much longer than would have been the case in the absence of such diffusive exchange. Simulations also suggest that aerobic degradation of MTBE or TBA at the water table in the overlying silt layer significantly affected concentrations of MTBE and TBA by limiting the chemical mass available for back diffusion to the aquifer.|1|2011|J.

Role of epoxide hydrolases in lipid metabolism|Morisseau, Christophe||Epoxide hydrolases (EH), enzymes present in all living organisms, transform epoxide-containing lipids to 1,2-diols by the addition of a molecule of water. Many of these oxygenated lipid substrates have potent biological activities: host defense, control of development, regulation of blood pressure, inflammation, and pain. In general, the bioactivity of these natural epoxides is significantly reduced upon metabolism to diols. Thus, through the regulation of the titer of lipid epoxides, EHs have important and diverse biological roles with profound effects on the physiological state of the host organism. This review will discuss the biological activity of key lipid epoxides in mammals.

Salinity-induced regulation of the myo-inositol biosynthesis pathway in tilapia gill epithelium|Sacchi, Romina; Li, Johnathon; Villarreal, Fernando; Gardell, Alison M.; Kültz, Dietmar||The myo-inositol biosynthesis (MIB) pathway converts glucose-6-phosphate to the compatible osmolyte myo-inositol that protects cells from osmotic stress. Using proteomics, the enzymes that constitute the MIB pathway, myo-inositol phosphate synthase (MIPS) and inositol monophosphatase 1 (IMPA1), are identified in tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) gill epithelium. Targeted, quantitative, label-free proteomics reveals that they are both upregulated during salinity stress. Upregulation is stronger when fish are exposed to severe (34 ppt acute and 90 ppt gradual) relative to moderate (70 ppt gradual) salinity stress. IMPA1 always responds more strongly than MIPS, suggesting that MIPS is more stable during salinity stress. MIPS is N-terminally acetylated and the corresponding peptide increases proportionally to MIPS protein, while non-acetylated N-terminal peptide is not detectable, indicating that MIPS acetylation is constitutive and may serve to stabilize the protein. Hyperosmotic induction of MIPS and IMPA1 is confirmed using western blot and real-time qPCR and is much higher at the mRNA than at the protein level. Two distinct MIPS mRNA variants are expressed in the gill, but one is more strongly regulated by salinity than the other. A single MIPS gene is encoded in the tilapia genome whereas the zebrafish genome lacks MIPS entirely. The genome of euryhaline tilapia contains four IMPA genes, two of which are expressed, but only one is salinity regulated in gill epithelium. The genome of stenohaline zebrafish contains a single IMPA gene. We conclude that the MIB pathway represents a major salinity stress coping mechanism that is regulated at multiple levels in euryhaline fish but absent in stenohaline zebrafish.|Core B|2013|J. Exp.

Scalar dissipation rates in non-conservative transport systems|Engdahl, Nicholas B.; Ginn, Timothy R.; Fogg, Graham E.|Environmental Monitoring/methods; Groundwater/analysis; Kinetics|This work considers how the inferred mixing state of diffusive and advective-diffusive systems will vary over time when the solute masses are not constant over time. We develop a number of tools that allow the scalar dissipation rate to be used as a mixing measure in these systems without calculating local concentration gradients. The behavior of dissipation rates is investigated for single and multi-component kinetic reactions and a commonly studied equilibrium reaction. The scalar dissipation rate of a tracer experiencing first-order decay can be determined exactly from the decay constant and the dissipation rate of a passive tracer, and the mixing rate of a conservative component is not the superposition of the solute specific mixing rates. We then show how the behavior of the scalar dissipation rate can be determined from a limited subset of an infinite domain. Corrections are derived for constant and time dependent limits of integration the latter is used to approximate dissipation rates in advective-diffusive systems. Several of the corrections exhibit similarities to the previous work on mixing, including non-Fickian mixing. This illustrates the importance of accounting for the effects that reaction systems or limited monitoring areas may have on the inferred mixing state.|1|2013|J. Contam. Hydrol.

Serum oxylipin profiles in IgA nephropathy patients reflect kidney functional alterations|Zivkovic, Angela M.; Yang, Jun; Georgi, Katrin; Hegedus, Christine; Nording, Malin L.; O'Sullivan, Aifric; German, J. Bruce; Hogg, Ronald J.; Weiss, Robert H.; Bay, Curt; Hammock, Bruce D.||Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease, frequently associated with hypertension and renal inflammation. omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in fish oil (FO) improve kidney function in animal models, but have inconsistent metabolic effects in humans. Oxylipin profiles in serum from IgAN patients supplemented with either FO or corn oil (CO) placebo were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. EPA cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase metabolites, and EPA and DHA epoxides and diols were increased in response to FO supplementation, as were total epoxides and epoxide/diol ratios. Several of these metabolites were drivers of separation as assessed by multivariate analysis of FO patients pre- vs. post-supplementation, including 17,18-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid, prostaglandin D3, prostagalandin E3, Resolvin E1, 12-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid, and 10(11)-epoxydocosapentaenoic acid. In patients whose proteinuria improved, plasma total oxylipins as well as several hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, and leukotriene B4 metabolites were among the metabolites that were significantly lower than in patients whose proteinuria either did not improve or worsened. These data support the involvement of oxylipins in the inflammatory component of IgAN as well as the potential use of oxylipin profiles as biomarkers and for assessing responsiveness to omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in IgAN patients.|Core A|2012|Metabolomics (Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society)||Zivkovic, Yang, Georgi, Hegedus, Nording, O'Sullivan, German, Hogg, Weiss, Bay, Hammock.

Serum proteins prevent aggregation of Fe2O3 and ZnO nanoparticles|Wells, Mark A.; Abid, Aamir; Kennedy, Ian M.; Barakat, Abdul I.||Aggregation of metal oxide nanoparticles in aqueous media complicates interpretation of in vitro studies of nanoparticle-cell interactions. We used dynamic light scattering to investigate the aggregation dynamics of iron oxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles. Our results show that iron oxide particles aggregate more readily than zinc oxide particles. Pretreatment with serum stabilises iron oxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles against aggregation. Serum-treated iron oxide is stable only in pure water, while zinc oxide is stable in water or cell culture media. These findings, combined with zeta potential measurements and quantification of proteins adsorbed on particle surface, suggest that serum stabilisation of iron oxide particles occurs primarily through protein adsorption and resulting net surface charge. Zinc oxide stabilisation, however, also involves steric hindrance of particle aggregation. Fluid shear at levels used in flow experiments breaks up iron oxide particle aggregates. These results enhance our understanding of nanoparticle aggregation and its consequences for research on the biological effects of nanomaterials.|7|2012|Nanotoxicology (Nanotoxicology)||Wells, Abid, Kennedy, Barakat.

Naphthalene (NA), an abundant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon in tobacco smoke and urban air, is a model toxicant for air pollution effects in the lung. Repeated exposures to NA in male mice result in tolerance, defined as the emergence of a resistant cell phenotype after prior exposure. Tolerance has not been studied in females. Females have sex differences in airway epithelial responses and in the prevalence of certain airway diseases. Male and female mice were exposed to a tolerance-inducing regimen of NA, and lungs were examined by airway level to characterize the cellular changes associated with repeated NA exposure and to assess the expression of genes and proteins involved in NA bioactivation and detoxification. The airway epithelium in treated males resembled that of controls. Females in the tolerant state were characterized by dense populations of ciliated cells in midlevel, distal, and bifurcating airways and a lower abundance of Clara cells at all airway levels. Cytotoxicity following a secondary challenge dose was also greater in females than males. Furthermore, females had decreased gene/protein expression of CYP2F2, a P-450 that metabolizes NA to a toxic epoxide, and glutamate-cysteine ligase, the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione synthesis, than NA-tolerant males at all airway levels examined. We conclude that, while females develop tolerance, sex differences exist in the tolerant state by airway level, and females remain more susceptible than males to repeated exposures to NA.|4|2012|Am.

Simultaneous determination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers and polychlorinated biphenyls by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in human serum and plasma|Lin, Yan-Ping; Pessah, Isaac N.; Puschner, Birgit||Sensitive and reliable methods for simultaneous determination of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in limited volumes of human serum or plasma need to be further documented especially when they accumulate at low levels that are still capable of disrupting endocrine and immune functions, and affecting neurodevelopment and reproduction. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a sensitive and quantitative method that simultaneously quantifies PBDEs and PCBs in 0.5 ml of human serum or plasma. We optimized a solid-phase extraction (SPE) method and used silica particle purification for the extraction of PBDEs and PCBs. Two multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) transitions were optimized for each congener. The sum of the transitions was used for quantification, and their abundance ratios were used for identification. The combined method optimization techniques resulted in limits of detection from 3 to 145 pg/ml for 10 PBDEs and 1-12 pg/ml for 15 PCBs. Method was solidly validated by analyzing serum fortified with a certified PBDE and PCB standard mixture from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The accuracy was 88-118% and day-to-day precision was within 19%. The method was successfully applied to quantify native concentrations of PBDE and PCB in commercially available human serum. The sensitivity and selectivity of the GC/EI-MS/MS analysis enables it to be the method of choice for investigations of exposures to PBDE and PCB congeners, especially when sample volume is limited.|5|2013|Talanta (Talanta)||Lin, Pessah, Puschner.

Elevated O(3) decreased soil mineral N likely through a reduction in plant material input and increased denitrification, which was evidenced by the greater abundance of the denitrifier gene nosZ. Elevated CO(2) did not alter the parameters evaluated and both elevated CO(2) and O(3) showed no interactive effects on nitrifier and denitrifier abundance, nor on total and mineral N concentrations. These results indicate that elevated CO(2) may have limited effects on N transformations in soybean agroecosystems. However, elevated O(3) can lead to a decrease in soil N availability in both bulk and rhizosphere soils, and this likely also affects ecosystem productivity by reducing the mineralization rates of plant-derived residues.|1|2011|Environmental pollution (Environ Pollut)||Pujol Pereira, Chung, Scow, Sadowsky, van Kessel, Six.

Soil Physical Constraints on Intrinsic Biodegradation of Petroleum Vapors in a Layered Subsurface|Kristensen, Andreas H.; Henriksen, Kaj; Mortensen, Lars; Scow, Kate M.; Moldrup, Per||Naturally occurring biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in the vadose zone depends on the physical soil environment influencing field-scale gas exchange and pore-scale microbial metabolism. In this study, we evaluated the effect of soil physical heterogeneity on biodegradation of petroleum vapors in a 16-m-deep, layered vadose zone. Soil slurry experiments (soil/water ratio 10:30 w/w, 25°C) on benzene biodegradation under aerobic and well-mixed conditions indicated that the biodegradation potential in different textured soil samples was related to soil type rather than depth, in the order: sandy loam > fine sand > limestone. Similarly, O(2) consumption rates during in situ respiration tests performed at the site were higher in the sandy loam than in the fine sand, although the difference was less significant than in the slurries. Laboratory and field data generally agreed well and suggested a significant potential for aerobic biodegradation, even with nutrient-poor and deep subsurface conditions. In slurries of the sandy loam, the biodegradation potential declined with increasing in situ water saturation (i.e., decreasing air-filled porosity in the field). This showed a relation between antecedent undisturbed field conditions and the slurry biodegradation potential, and suggested airfilled porosity to be a key factor for the intrinsic biodegradation potential in the field.|1|2010|Vadose Zone J (Vadose zone journal : VZJ)||Kristensen, Henriksen, Mortensen, Scow, Moldrup.

In the present study, using a tissue microarray and immunohistochemical approach, a significant increase of sEH expression was identified in ulcerative colitis (UC)-associated dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. The effects of deficiency in the sEH gene were determined on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis-induced carcinogenesis. The effects of EETs on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages were analyzed in vitro. With extensive histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses, compared to wild-type mice, sEH(-/-) mice exhibited a significant decrease in tumor incidence (13/20 vs. 6/19, p<0.05) and a markedly reduced average tumor size (59.62±20.91 mm(3) vs. 22.42±11.22 mm(3)), and a significant number of pre-cancerous dysplasia (3±1.18 vs. 2±0.83, p<0.01). The inflammatory activity, as measured by the extent/proportion of erosion/ulceration/dense lymphoplasmacytosis (called active colitis index) in the colon, was significantly lower in sEH(-/-) mice (44.7%±24.9% vs. 20.2%±16.2%, p<0.01). The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays demonstrated significantly low levels of cytokines/chemokines including monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), vasopressin-activated calcium-mobilizing (VCAM-1), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). In vitro, LPS-activated macrophages treated with 14,15-EET showed a significant reduction of LPS-triggered IL-1β and TNF-α expression. Eicosanoic acid metabolic profiling revealed a significant increase of the ratios of EETs/ dihydroeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) and epoxyoctadecennoic acid/dihydroxyoctadecenoic acid (EpOMEs/DiHOMEs).

Soluble epoxide hydrolase gene deficiency or inhibition attenuates chronic active inflammatory bowel disease in IL-10(-/-) mice|Zhang, Wanying; Yang, Allison L.; Liao, Jie; Li, Haonan; Dong, Hua; Chung, Yeon Tae; Bai, Han; Matkowskyj, Kristina A.; Hammock, Bruce D.; Yang, Guang-Yu|Animals; Benzoates/pharmacology; Chronic Disease; Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/toxicity; Cytokines/genetics/metabolism; Disease Models, Animal; Epoxide Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/chemically induced/drug therapy/metabolism; Interleukin-10/genetics/metabolism; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Piroxicam/toxicity; Urea/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology|BACKGROUND: Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) metabolizes anti-inflammatory epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) into their much less active dihydroxy derivatives dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids. Thus, targeting sEH would be important for inflammation. AIMS: To determine whether knockout or inhibition of sEH would attenuate the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a mouse model of IBD in IL-10(-/-) mice. METHODS: Either the small molecule sEH inhibitor trans/-4-[4-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-cyclohexyloxy]-benzoic acid (t-AUCB) or sEH knockout mice were used in combination with IL-10(-/-) mice. t-AUCB was administered to mice in drinking fluid. Extensive histopathologic, immunochemical, and biochemical analyses were performed to evaluate effect of sEH inhibition or deficiency on chronic active inflammation and related mechanism in the bowel. RESULTS: Compared to IL-10 (-/-) mice, sEH inhibition or sEH deficiency in IL-10(-/-) mice resulted in significantly lower incidence of active ulcer formation and transmural inflammation, along with a significant decrease in myeloperoxidase-labeled neutrophil infiltration in the inflamed bowel. The levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and MCP-1, as well VCAM-1 and NF-kB/IKK-α signals were significantly decreased as compared to control animals. Moreover, an eicosanoid profile analysis revealed a significant increase in the ratio of EETs/DHET and EpOME/DiOME, and a slightly down-regulation of inflammatory mediators LTB(4) and 5-HETE. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that sEH gene deficiency or inhibition reduces inflammatory activities in the IL-10 (-/-) mouse model of IBD, and that sEH inhibitor could be a highly potential in the treatment of IBD.|Core A|2012|Dig.

Renal cytoplasmic epoxide hydrolase-2 (Ephx2) gene expression was enhanced in SHR vs. WKY from 2 days to 24 wk. Effects of perinatal treatment with AUDA, supplied to SHR dams until 4 wk after birth, on BP in female and male offspring and renal oxylipin metabolome in female offspring were observed and contrasted to female SHR for direct effects of AUDA (8-12 wk). Briefly, inhibition of SEH was effective in persistently reducing BP in female SHR when applied during the perinatal phase. This was accompanied by marked increases in major renal AA epoxides and decreases in renal lipoxygenase products of AA. Early inhibition of SEH induced a delayed increase in renal 5-HETE at 24 wk, in contrast to a decrease at 2 wk. Inhibition of SEH in female SHR from 8 to 12 wk did not reduce BP but caused profound decreases in renal 15(S)-HETrE, LTB4, TBX2, 5-HETE, and 20-HETE and increases in TriHOMEs. In male SHR, BP reduction after perinatal AUDA was transient. Thus, Ephx2 transcription and SEH activity in early life may initiate mechanisms that eventually contribute to high BP in adult female SHR. However, programmed BP-lowering effects of perinatal SEH inhibition in female SHR cannot be simply explained by persistent reduction in renal SEH activity but rather by more complex and temporally dynamic interactions between the renal SEH, lipoxygenase, and cyclooxygenase pathways.|5|2011|Am.

Soluble epoxide hydrolase in the generation and maintenance of high blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats|Koeners, Maarten P.; Wesseling, Sebastiaan; Ulu, Arzu; Sepúlveda, Rocío López; Morisseau, Christophe; Braam, Branko; Hammock, Bruce D.; Joles, Jaap A.|Adamantane/analogs & derivatives; Age Factors; Animals; Enzyme Inhibitors; Epoxide Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/physiology; Female; Gestational Age; Hypertension/chemically induced/pathology/physiopathology; Lauric Acids; Male; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/chemically induced/pathology/physiopathology; Rats; Rats, Inbred SHR; Rats, Inbred WKY; Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics/physiology; Solubility|We hypothesized that perinatal inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (SEH), which metabolizes epoxyeicosatrienoic acids in the arachidonic acid (AA) cascade, with an orally active SEH inhibitor, 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-dodecanoic acid (AUDA), would persistently reduce blood pressure (BP) in adult SHR despite discontinuation of AUDA at 4 wk of age. Renal cytoplasmic epoxide hydrolase-2 (Ephx2) gene expression was enhanced in SHR vs. WKY from 2 days to 24 wk. Effects of perinatal treatment with AUDA, supplied to SHR dams until 4 wk after birth, on BP in female and male offspring and renal oxylipin metabolome in female offspring were observed and contrasted to female SHR for direct effects of AUDA (8-12 wk). Briefly, inhibition of SEH was effective in persistently reducing BP in female SHR when applied during the perinatal phase. This was accompanied by marked increases in major renal AA epoxides and decreases in renal lipoxygenase products of AA. Early inhibition of SEH induced a delayed increase in renal 5-HETE at 24 wk, in contrast to a decrease at 2 wk. Inhibition of SEH in female SHR from 8 to 12 wk did not reduce BP but caused profound decreases in renal 15(S)-HETrE, LTB4, TBX2, 5-HETE, and 20-HETE and increases in TriHOMEs. In male SHR, BP reduction after perinatal AUDA was transient. Thus, Ephx2 transcription and SEH activity in early life may initiate mechanisms that eventually contribute to high BP in adult female SHR. However, programmed BP-lowering effects of perinatal SEH inhibition in female SHR cannot be simply explained by persistent reduction in renal SEH activity but rather by more complex and temporally dynamic interactions between the renal SEH, lipoxygenase, and cyclooxygenase pathways.|Core A|2011|Am.

Soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor attenuates inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in mice|Yang, Jun; Bratt, Jennifer; Franzi, Lisa; Liu, Junyan; Zhang, Guodong; Zeki, Amir A.; Vogel, Christoph F A; Williams, Keisha; Dong, Hua; Lin, Yanping; Hwang, Sung Hee; Kenyon, Nicholas J.; Hammock, Bruce D.||Rationale: Control of airway inflammation is critical in asthma treatment. The soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) has recently been demonstrated as a novel therapeutic target for treating inflammation, including lung inflammation. Here, we hypothesize that pharmacological inhibition of sEH can modulate the inflammatory response in a murine ovalbumin (OVA) model of asthma. Methods: BALB/c mice were sensitized and exposed to OVA over 6 weeks. The sEH inhibitor (sEHI) was administrated for two weeks. Respiratory system compliance, resistance and forced exhale nitric oxide were measured. Lung lavage cell counts were performed and a selected panel of cytokines and chemokines in the lung lavage fluid were measured by a Multiplex immunoassay kit. A liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method was used to measure 87 regulatory lipids mediators in plasma, lung tissue homogenates, and lung lavage fluid. Results: The pharmacological inhibition of sEH increased the concentrations of the anti-inflammatory epoxy eicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and simultaneously decreased the concentrations of the pro-inflammatory dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) and dihydroxyoctadecenoic acids (DHOMEs). All monitored inflammatory markers, which including FeNO levels, and total cell and eosinophil numbers in the lung lavage of OVA-exposed mice were reduced by sEHI. The Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5) and chemokines (Eotaxin and RANTES) were dramatically reduced after administration of sEHI. Moreover, the resistance and dynamic lung compliance were also improved by sEHI. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the administration of an sEHI attenuates allergic airway inflammation and airway responsiveness in a murine model. sEHI may have potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for allergic asthma.|Core A|2014|Am.

Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Inhibitors and Heart Failure|Qiu, Hong; Li, Ning; Liu, Jun-Yan; Harris, Todd R.; Hammock, Bruce D.; Chiamvimonvat, Nipavan||Cardiovascular disease remains one of the leading causes of death in the Western societies. Heart failure (HF) is due primarily to progressive myocardial dysfunction accompanied by myocardial remodeling. Once HF develops, the condition is, in most cases, irreversible and is associated with a very high mortality rate. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which are lipid mediators derived from arachidonic acid through the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase pathway. EETs have been shown to have vasodilatory, antiinflammatory, and cardioprotective effects. When EETs are hydrolyzed by sEH to corresponding dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids, their cardioprotective activities become less pronounced. In line with the recent genetic study that has identified sEH as a susceptibility gene for HF, the sEH enzyme has received considerable attention as an attractive therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases. Indeed, sEH inhibition has been demonstrated to have antihypertensive and antiinflammatory actions, presumably due to the increased bioavailability of endogenous EETs and other epoxylipids, and several potent sEH inhibitors have been developed and tested in animal models of cardiovascular disease including hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and ischemia/reperfusion injury. sEH inhibitor treatment has been shown to effectively prevent pressure overload- and angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and reverse the pre-established cardiac hypertrophy caused by chronic pressure overload. Application of sEH inhibitors in several cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury models reduced infarct size and prevented the progressive cardiac remodeling. Moreover, the use of sEH inhibitors prevented the development of electrical remodeling and ventricular arrhythmias associated with cardiac hypertrophy and ischemia/reperfusion injury. The data published to date support the notion that sEH inhibitors may represent a promising therapeutic approach for combating detrimental cardiac remodeling and HF.|Core A|2010|Cardiovasc Ther (Cardiovascular therapeutics)||Qiu, Li, Liu, Harris, Hammock, Chiamvimonvat.

Soluble epoxide hydrolase plays an essential role in angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy|Ai, Ding; Pang, Wei; Li, Nan; Xu, Ming; Jones, Paul D.; Yang, Jun; Zhang, Youyi; Chiamvimonvat, Nipavan; Shyy, John Y-J; Hammock, Bruce D.; Zhu, Yi|Angiotensin II/pharmacology; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Cardiomegaly/chemically induced/enzymology/etiology; Epoxide Hydrolases/analysis/deficiency/genetics; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Myocardium/enzymology; Myocytes, Cardiac/enzymology; Rats; Up-Regulation|Pathophysiological cardiac hypertrophy is one of the most common causes of heart failure. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, hydrolyzed and degraded by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), can function as endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors to induce dilation of coronary arteries and thus are cardioprotective. In this study, we investigated the role of sEH in two rodent models of angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cardiac hypertrophy. The protein level of sEH was elevated in the heart of both spontaneously hypertensive rats and Ang II-infused Wistar rats. Blocking the Ang II type 1 receptor with losartan could abolish this induction. Administration of a potent sEH inhibitor (sEHI) prevented the pathogenesis of the Ang II-induced hypertrophy, as demonstrated by decreased left-ventricular hypertrophy assessed by echocardiography, reduced cardiomyocyte size, and attenuated expression of hypertrophy markers, including atrial natriuretic factor and beta-myosin heavy chain. Because sEH elevation was not observed in exercise- or norepinephrine-induced hypertrophy, the sEH induction was closely associated with Ang II-induced hypertrophy. In vitro, Ang II upregulated sEH and hypertrophy markers in neonatal cardiomyocytes isolated from rat and mouse. Expression of these marker genes was elevated with adenovirus-mediated sEH overexpression but decreased with sEHI treatment. These results were supported by studies in neonatal cardiomyocytes from sEH(-/-) mice. Our results suggest that sEH is specifically upregulated by Ang II, which directly mediates Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of sEH would be a useful approach to prevent and treat Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy.|Core A|2009|Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.

Stabilized epoxygenated fatty acids regulate inflammation, pain, angiogenesis and cancer|Zhang, Guodong; Kodani, Sean; Hammock, Bruce D.||Epoxygenated fatty acids (EpFAs), which are lipid mediators produced by cytochrome P450 epoxygenases from polyunsaturated fatty acids, are important signaling molecules known to regulate various biological processes including inflammation, pain and angiogenesis. The EpFAs are further metabolized by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to form fatty acid diols which are usually less-active. Pharmacological inhibitors of sEH that stabilize endogenous EpFAs are being considered for human clinical uses.

Structure-activity relationship of non-coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls toward skeletal muscle ryanodine receptors in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)|Fritsch, Erika B.; Pessah, Isaac N.||Research addressing the health impacts of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has primarily focused on the effects of coplanar, or dioxin-like (DL), congeners, which is especially true for research assessing impacts in fish species. Ortho substituted non-coplanar, termed non-dioxin-like (NDL), PCBs have received less attention. In mammals, NDL PCBs enhance the activity of ryanodine receptors (RyR), calcium release channels necessary for engaging excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in striated muscle. We utilized in vitro receptor binding analysis to determine whether NDL PCB congeners detected in aquatic environments alter the activity of RyR isoform 1 (RyR1) found in the skeletal muscle of rainbow trout. Congeners 52, 95, 136, and149 were the most efficacious leading to an increase in receptor activity that was approximately 250% greater than that found under solvent control conditions. Other environmentally relevant congeners, namely PCB 153, 151 and 101, which all contain two or more chlorines in the ortho-position, enhanced receptor activity by greater than 160% of baseline. The mono-ortho congeners or the non-ortho PCB 77 had negligible impact on the RyR1. When combined, in binary or environmentally relevant mixtures, congeners shown to enhance receptor activity appeared to display additivity and when the active PCB 95 was present with the non-active congener PCB 77 the impact on receptor activity was reduced from 250% to 230%. The important role of the RyR and the demonstrated additive nature of NDL congeners toward altering channel function calls for further investigation into the ecological implications of altered RyR function in fish with high PCB burdens.|5|2013|Aquat Toxicol (Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands))||Fritsch, Pessah.

Structure-Activity Relationship of Selected Meta- and Para-Hydroxylated Non-Dioxin Like Polychlorinated Biphenyls: From Single RyR1 Channels to Muscle Dysfunction|Niknam, Yassaman; Feng, Wei; Cherednichenko, Gennady; Dong, Yao; Joshi, Sudhir N.; Vyas, Sandhya M.; Lehmler, Hans-Joachim; Pessah, Isaac N.||Non-dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls (NDL-PCBs) are legacy environmental contaminants with contemporary unintentional sources. NDL-PCBs interact with ryanodine receptors (RyRs), Ca(2+) channels of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) that regulate excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) and Ca(2+)-dependent cell signaling in muscle. Activities of 4 chiral congeners PCB91, 95, 132, and 149 and their respective 4- and 5-hydroxy (-OH) derivatives toward rabbit skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) are investigated using [(3)H]ryanodine binding and SR Ca(2+) flux analyses. Although 5-OH metabolites have comparable activity to their respective parent in both assays, 4-OH derivatives are unable to trigger Ca(2+) release from SR microsomes in the presence of Ca(2+)-ATPase activity. PCB95 and derivatives are investigated using single channel voltage-clamp and primary murine embryonic muscle cells (myotubes). Like PCB95, 5-OH-PCB95 quickly and persistently increases channel open probability (p o > .9) by stabilizing the full-open channel state, whereas 4-OH-PCB95 transiently enhances p o. Ca(2+) imaging of myotubes loaded with Fluo-4 show that acute exposure to PCB95 (5µM) potentiates ECC and caffeine responses and partially depletes SR Ca(2+) stores. Exposure to 5-OH-PCB95 (5 µM) increases cytoplasmic Ca(2+), leading to rapid ECC failure in 50% of myotubes with the remainder retaining negligible responses. 4-OH-PCB95 neither increases baseline Ca(2+) nor causes ECC failure but depresses ECC and caffeine responses by 50%. With longer (3h) exposure to 300nM PCB95, 5-OH-PCB95, or 4-OH-PCB95 decreases the number of ECC responsive myotubes by 22%, 81%, and 51% compared with control by depleting SR Ca(2+) and/or uncoupling ECC. NDL-PCBs and their 5-OH and 4-OH metabolites differentially influence RyR1 channel activity and ECC in embryonic skeletal muscle.|5|2013|Toxicol. Sci.

Substituted phenyl groups improve the pharmacokinetic profile and anti-inflammatory effect of urea-based soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors in murine models|Liu, Jun-Yan; Lin, Yan-Ping; Qiu, Hong; Morisseau, Christophe; Rose, Tristan E.; Hwang, Sung Hee; Chiamvimonvat, Nipavan; Hammock, Bruce D.||Soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors (sEHIs) are anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-hypertensive, cardio- and renal-protective in multiple animal models. However, the earlier adamantyl-containing urea-based inhibitors are rapidly metabolized.

Here we describe the improved PK profile of these inhibitors and the anti-inflammatory effect of the most promising one in a murine model. The PK profiles of inhibitors were determined following p.o. administration and serial bleeding in mice.

Superparamagnetic particle dynamics and mixing in a rotating capillary tube with a stationary magnetic field|Lee, Jun-Tae; Abid, Aamir; Cheung, Ka Ho; Sudheendra, L.; Kennedy, Ian M.||The dynamics of superparamagnetic particles subject to competing magnetic and viscous drag forces have been examined with a uniform, stationary, external magnetic field. In this approach, competing drag and magnetic forces were created in a fluid suspension of superparamagnetic particles that was confined in a capillary tube; competing viscous drag and magnetic forces were established by rotating the tube. A critical Mason number was determined for conditions under which the rotation of the capillary prevents the formation of chains from individual particles. The statistics of chain length were investigated by image analysis while varying parameters such as the rotation speed and the viscosity of the liquid. The measurements showed that the rate of particle chain formation was decreased with increased viscosity and rotation speed ; the particle dynamics could be quantified by the same dimensionless Mason number that has been demonstrated for rotating magnetic fields. The potential for enhancement of mixing in a bioassay was assessed using a fast chemical reaction that was diffusion-limited. Reducing the Mason below the critical value, so that chains were formed in the fluid, gave rise to a modest improvement in the time to completion of the reaction.|2|2012|Microfluid Nanofluidics (Microfluidics and nanofluidics)||Lee, Abid, Cheung, Sudheendra, Kennedy.

Young children are especially susceptible to PM and can experience altered anatomic, physiologic, and biological responses. Current studies of ambient PM are confounded by the complex mixture of soot, metals, allergens, and organics present in the complex mixture as well as seasonal and temporal variance. We have developed a laboratory-based PM devoid of metals and allergens that can be replicated to study health effects of specific PM components in animal models. We exposed 7-day-old postnatal and adult rats to a single 6-h exposure of fuel-rich ultrafine premixed flame particles (PFPs) or filtered air. These particles are high in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons content. Pulmonary cytotoxicity, gene, and protein expression were evaluated at 2 and 24 h postexposure. Neonates were more susceptible to PFP, exhibiting increased lactate dehydrogenase activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and ethidium homodimer-1 cellular staining in the lung in situ as an index of cytotoxicity. Basal gene expression between neonates and adults differed for a significant number of antioxidant, oxidative stress, and proliferation genes and was further altered by PFP exposure. PFP diminishes proliferation marker PCNA gene and protein expression in neonates but not adults. We conclude that neonates have an impaired ability to respond to environmental exposures that increases lung cytotoxicity and results in enhanced susceptibility to PFP, which may lead to abnormal airway growth.|4|2011|Toxicol.

Susceptibility to inhaled flame-generated ultrafine soot in neonatal and adult rat lungs|Chan, Jackie K.

Young children are especially susceptible to PM and can experience altered anatomic, physiologic, and biological responses. Current studies of ambient PM are confounded by the complex mixture of soot, metals, allergens, and organics present in the complex mixture as well as seasonal and temporal variance. We have developed a laboratory-based PM devoid of metals and allergens that can be replicated to study health effects of specific PM components in animal models. We exposed 7-day-old postnatal and adult rats to a single 6-h exposure of fuel-rich ultrafine premixed flame particles (PFPs) or filtered air. These particles are high in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons content. Pulmonary cytotoxicity, gene, and protein expression were evaluated at 2 and 24 h postexposure. Neonates were more susceptible to PFP, exhibiting increased lactate dehydrogenase activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and ethidium homodimer-1 cellular staining in the lung in situ as an index of cytotoxicity. Basal gene expression between neonates and adults differed for a significant number of antioxidant, oxidative stress, and proliferation genes and was further altered by PFP exposure. PFP diminishes proliferation marker PCNA gene and protein expression in neonates but not adults. We conclude that neonates have an impaired ability to respond to environmental exposures that increases lung cytotoxicity and results in enhanced susceptibility to PFP, which may lead to abnormal airway growth.|7|2011|Toxicol.

Tetramethylenedisulfotetramine alters Ca²⁺ dynamics in cultured hippocampal neurons: mitigation by NMDA receptor blockade and GABA(A) receptor-positive modulation|Cao, Zhengyu; Hammock, Bruce D.; McCoy, Mark; Rogawski, Michael A.; Lein, Pamela J.; Pessah, Isaac N.||Tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TETS) is a potent convulsant that is considered a chemical threat agent. We characterized TETS as an activator of spontaneous Ca²⁺ oscillations and electrical burst discharges in mouse hippocampal neuronal cultures at 13-17 days in vitro using FLIPR Fluo-4 fluorescence measurements and extracellular microelectrode array recording. Acute exposure to TETS (≥ 2 µM) reversibly altered the pattern of spontaneous neuronal discharges, producing clustered burst firing and an overall increase in discharge frequency. TETS also dramatically affected Ca²⁺ dynamics causing an immediate but transient elevation of neuronal intracellular Ca²⁺ followed by decreased frequency of Ca²⁺ oscillations but greater peak amplitude. The effect on Ca²⁺ dynamics was similar to that elicited by picrotoxin and bicuculline, supporting the view that TETS acts by inhibiting type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor function. The effect of TETS on Ca²⁺ dynamics requires activation of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors, because the changes induced by TETS were prevented by MK-801 block of NMDA receptors, but not nifedipine block of L-type Ca²⁺ channels. Pretreatment with the GABA(A) receptor-positive modulators diazepam and allopregnanolone partially mitigated TETS-induced changes in Ca²⁺ dynamics. Moreover, low, minimally effective concentrations of diazepam (0.1 µM) and allopregnanolone (0.1 µM), when administered together, were highly effective in suppressing TETS-induced alterations in Ca²⁺ dynamics, suggesting that the combination of positive modulators of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors may have therapeutic potential. These rapid throughput in vitro assays may assist in the identification of single agents or combinations that have utility in the treatment of TETS intoxication.|5|2012|Toxicol. Sci.

Inhibition of the EET regulatory enzyme, soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) also has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects in vivo including reduced leukocyte recruitment to the lung. We tested the hypothesis that the in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of sEH inhibitors act through the same mechanisms as the in vitro anti-inflammatory effects of EETs in a rat model of acute inflammation following exposure to tobacco smoke. Contrary to previously published data, we found that sEH inhibition did not reduce tobacco smoke-induced leukocyte recruitment to the lung. Furthermore, sEH inhibition did not reduce tobacco smoke-induced adhesion molecule expression in the lung vasculature. Similarly, concentrations of EETs greater than or equal to their reported effective dose did not reduce TNFα induced expression of the adhesion molecules. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of sEH inhibitors are independent of leukocyte recruitment and EETs do not reduce the adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte recruitment in vitro.

The effects of TCC were studied in the freshwater mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum. Specimens were exposed to concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 10.5 microg/L dissolved TCC and were removed and dissected, and embryos contained within the brood pouch were counted and classified as shelled or unshelled after two and four weeks of exposure. After four weeks, environmentally relevant TCC concentrations of 1.6 to 10.5 microg/L resulted in statistically significant increases in the number of unshelled embryos, whereas 0.2, 1.6, and 10.5 microg/L exposures significantly increased numbers of shelled embryos. The lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) was 0.2 microg/L, the no observed effect concentration (NOEC) was 0.05 microg/L; the 10% effective concentration (EC10) and the median effective concentration (EC50) for unshelled effects were 0.5 microg/L and 2.5 microg/L, respectively. Given the widespread occurrence of TCC in the environment and the effects shown at environmentally relevant concentrations, these results indicate that TCC may be causing reproductive effects in the environment. Furthermore, the present study indicates that environmental risk from a new class of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) is both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to risk from existing classes of EDCs.|1|2010|Environ.

The high gene count is a consequence of an elevated rate of gene duplication resulting in tandem gene clusters. More than a third of Daphnia's genes have no detectable homologs in any other available proteome, and the most amplified gene families are specific to the Daphnia lineage. The coexpansion of gene families interacting within metabolic pathways suggests that the maintenance of duplicated genes is not random, and the analysis of gene expression under different environmental conditions reveals that numerous paralogs acquire divergent expression patterns soon after duplication.

The Environmental Neurotoxicant PCB 95 Promotes Synaptogenesis via Ryanodine Receptor-Dependent miR132 Upregulation|Lesiak, Adam; Zhu, Mingyan; Chen, Hao; Appleyard, Suzanne M.; Impey, Soren; Lein, Pamela J.; Wayman, Gary A.||Non-dioxin-like (NDL) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are widespread environmental contaminants linked to neuropsychological dysfunction in children. NDL PCBs increase spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations in neurons by stabilizing ryanodine receptor (RyR) calcium release channels in the open configuration, which results in CREB-dependent dendritic outgrowth. In this study, we address the question of whether activation of CREB by NDL PCBs also triggers dendritic spine formation. Nanomolar concentrations of PCB 95, a NDL congener with potent RyR activity, significantly increased spine density and the frequency of miniature EPSCs in primary dissociated rat hippocampal cultures coincident with upregulation of miR132. Inhibition of RyR, CREB, or miR132 as well as expression of a mutant p250GAP cDNA construct that is not suppressed by miR132 blocked PCB 95 effects on spines and miniature EPSCs. PCB 95 also induced spine formation via RyR- and miR132-dependent mechanisms in hippocampal slice cultures. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism of PCB developmental neurotoxicity whereby RyR sensitization modulates spine formation and synaptogenesis via CREB-mediated miR132 upregulation, which in turn suppresses the translation of p250GAP, a negative regulator of synaptogenesis. In light of recent evidence implicating miR132 dysregulation in Rett syndrome and schizophrenia, these findings identify NDL PCBs as potential environmental risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders.|5|2014|J Neurosci (The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience)||Lesiak, Zhu, Chen, Appleyard, Impey, Lein, Wayman.

The authors then compared the in vivo response with an in vitro assay--chemical activated luciferase gene expression (CALUX). Juvenile M. beryllina exposed to bifenthrin (1, 10, 100 ng/L), permethrin (0.1, 1, 10 microg/L), and ethinylestradiol (1, 10, 50 ng/L) had significantly higher ng/mL choriogenin (Chg) measured in whole body homogenate than controls. Though Chg expression in fish exposed to ethinylestradiol (EE2) exhibited a traditional sigmoidal concentration response, curves fit to Chg expressed in fish exposed to pyrethroids suggest a unimodal response, decreasing slightly as concentration increases. Whereas the in vivo response indicated that bifenthrin and permethrin or their metabolites act as estrogen agonists, the CALUX assay demonstrated estrogen antagonism by the pyrethroids. The results, supported by evidence from previous studies, suggest that bifenthrin and permethrin, or their metabolites, appear to act as estrogen receptor (ER) agonists in vivo, and that the unmetabolized pyrethroids, particularly bifenthrin, act as an ER antagonists in cultured mammalian cells.|5|2012|Environ Toxicol Chem (Environmental toxicology and chemistry / SETAC)||Brander, He, Smalling, Denison, Cherr.

Therapeutic activity of inhibition of the soluble epoxide hydrolase in a mouse model of scrapie|Poli, Giorgio; Corda, Erica; Martino, Piera Anna; Dall'ara, Paola; Bareggi, Silvio R.; Bondiolotti, Giampietro; Iulini, Barbara; Mazza, Maria; Casalone, Cristina; Hwang, Sung Hee; Hammock, Bruce D.; Inceoglu, Bora||AIMS: The misfolding and the aggregation of specific proteins are key features of neurodegenerative diseases, specifically Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs). In TSEs, neuronal loss and inflammation are associated with the accumulation of the misfolded isoform (PrP(sc)) of the cellular prion protein (PrP(c)). Therefore we tested the hypothesis that augmenting a natural anti-inflammatory pathway mediated by epoxygenated fatty acids (EpFAs) will delay lethality. EpFAs are highly potent but enzymatically labile molecules produced by the actions of a number of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Stabilization of these bioactive lipids by inhibiting their degradation mediated by the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) results in potent anti-inflammatory effects in multiple disease models. MAIN METHODS: Mice were infected with the mouse-adapted RML strain of scrapie by intracerebral or intraperitoneal routes. Animals received the sEH inhibitor, by oral route, administrated in drinking water or vehicle (PEG400). Infected mice were euthanized at a standard clinical end point. Histopathological, immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses of brain tissue confirmed the presence of pathology related to prion infection. KEY FINDINGS: Oral administration of the sEHI did not affect the very short survival time of the intracerebral prion infection group. However, mice infected by intraperitoneal route and treated with t-AUCB survived significantly longer than the control group mice (p<0.001). SIGNIFICANCE: These findings support the idea that inhibition of sEH or augmentation of the natural EpFA signaling in the brain offers a potential and different route to understand prion diseases and may become a therapeutic strategy for diseases involving neuroinflammation.|Core A|2013|Life Sci.

Third-generation Ah receptor-responsive luciferase reporter plasmids: amplification of dioxin-responsive elements dramatically increases CALUX bioassay sensitivity and responsiveness|He, Guochun; Tsutsumi, Tomoaki; Zhao, Bin; Baston, David S.; Zhao, Jing; Heath-Pagliuso, Sharon; Denison, Michael S.|Animals; Biological Assay; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/metabolism; Cell Line, Tumor; Clone Cells; Environmental Monitoring/methods; Enzyme Induction; Humans; Luciferases/biosynthesis/genetics; Mice; Plasmids/genetics; Predictive Value of Tests; Rats; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/drug effects/genetics/metabolism; Reproducibility of Results; Response Elements/drug effects/genetics; Species Specificity; Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin/pharmacology; Transcription, Genetic/drug effects; Transfection; Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis/toxicity|2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD, dioxin) and related dioxin-like chemicals are widespread and persistent environmental contaminants that produce diverse toxic and biological effects through their ability to bind to and activate the Ah receptor (AhR) and AhR-dependent gene expression. The chemically activated luciferase expression (CALUX) system is an AhR-responsive recombinant luciferase reporter gene-based cell bioassay that has been used in combination with chemical extraction and cleanup methods for the relatively rapid and inexpensive detection and relative quantitation of dioxin and dioxin-like chemicals in a wide variety of sample matrices. Although the CALUX bioassay has been validated and used extensively for screening purposes, it has some limitations when screening samples with very low levels of dioxin-like chemicals or when there is only a small amount of sample matrix for analysis. Here, we describe the development of third-generation (G3) CALUX plasmids with increased numbers of dioxin-responsive elements, and stable transfection of these new plasmids into mouse hepatoma (Hepa1c1c7) cells has produced novel amplified G3 CALUX cell bioassays that respond to TCDD with a dramatically increased magnitude of luciferase induction and significantly lower minimal detection limit than existing CALUX-type cell lines. The new G3 CALUX cell lines provide a highly responsive and sensitive bioassay system for the detection and relative quantitation of very low levels of dioxin-like chemicals in sample extracts.|5|2011|Toxicol.

Thyroid hormones and thyroid disease in relation to perchlorate dose and residence near a superfund site|Gold, Ellen B.; Blount, Benjamin C.; O'Neill Rasor, Marianne; Lee, Jennifer S.; Alwis, Udeni; Srivastav, Anup; Kim, Kyoungmi||Perchlorate is a widely occurring contaminant, which can competitively inhibit iodide uptake and thus thyroid hormone production. The health effects of chronic low dose perchlorate exposure are largely unknown. In a community-based study, we compared thyroid function and disease in women with differing likelihoods of prior and current perchlorate exposure. Residential blocks were randomly selected from areas: (1) with potential perchlorate exposure via drinking water; (2) with potential exposure to environmental contaminants; and (3) neighboring but without such exposures. Eligibility included having lived in the area for >/=6 months and aged 20-50 years during 1988-1996 (during documented drinking water well contamination). We interviewed 814 women and collected blood samples (assayed for thyroid stimulating hormone and free thyroxine) from 431 interviewed women. Daily urine samples were assayed for perchlorate and iodide for 178 premenopausal women with blood samples. We performed multivariable regression analyses comparing thyroid function and disease by residential area and by urinary perchlorate dose adjusted for urinary iodide levels. Residential location and current perchlorate dose were not associated with thyroid function or disease. No persistent effect of perchlorate on thyroid function or disease was found several years after contaminated wells were capped.|1|2013|J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol (Journal of exposure science & environmental epidemiology)||Gold, Blount, O'Neill Rasor, Lee, Alwis, Srivastav, Kim.

Tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) brain cells respond to hyperosmotic challenge by inducing myo-inositol biosynthesis|Gardell, Alison M.; Yang, Jun; Sacchi, Romina; Fangue, Nann A.; Hammock, Bruce D.; Kültz, Dietmar||This study aimed to determine the regulation of the de novo myo-inositol biosynthetic (MIB) pathway in Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) brain following acute (25 ppt) and chronic (30, 60 and 90 ppt) salinity acclimations. The MIB pathway plays an important role in accumulating the compatible osmolyte, myo-inositol, in cells in response to hyperosmotic challenge and consists of two enzymes, myo-inositol phosphate synthase and inositol monophosphatase. In tilapia brain, MIB enzyme transcriptional regulation was found to robustly increase in a time (acute acclimation) or dose (chronic acclimation) dependent manner. Blood plasma osmolality and Na(+) and Cl(-) concentrations were also measured and significantly increased in response to both acute and chronic salinity challenges. Interestingly, highly significant positive correlations were found between MIB enzyme mRNA and blood plasma osmolality in both acute and chronic salinity acclimations. Additionally, a mass spectrometry assay was established and used to quantify total myo-inositol concentration in tilapia brain, which closely mirrored the hyperosmotic MIB pathway induction. Thus, myo-inositol is a major compatible osmolyte that is accumulated in brain cells when exposed to acute and chronic hyperosmotic challenge. These data show that the MIB pathway is highly induced in response to environmental salinity challenge in tilapia brain and that this induction is likely prompted by increases in blood plasma osmolality. Because the MIB pathway uses glucose-6-phosphate as a substrate and large amounts of myo-inositol are being synthesized, our data also illustrate that the MIB pathway likely contributes to the high energetic demand posed by salinity challenge.|Core A|2013|J.

Time-integrated monitoring of dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) in aquatic environments using the ceramic toximeter and the CALUX bioassay|Addeck, Amr; Croes, Kim; van Langenhove, Kersten; Denison, Michael S.; Afify, Ahmed S.; Gao, Yue; Elskens, Marc; Baeyens, Willy||Ceramic passive samplers or toximeters (packed with active carbon 1%, w/w, on celite), in combination with the CALUX bioassay have been used as a time-integrated monitoring technique for dissolved dioxin-like PCBs in urban and industrial wastewaters. The technique showed to be reliable during laboratory experiments: (1) PCB-126 amounts extracted from the passive samplers increased linearly with the time of exposure and (2) PCB-126 concentrations calculated from the amounts accumulated by the passive samplers were in agreement with their concentrations in the testing solution. Afterwards the toximeters were applied in the field. Two sampling sites located in Egypt were chosen: the Belbeis drainage canal, and the EMAK paper mill. A total of 18 ceramic toximeters were exposed to the wastewater in both sampling sites for a maximum period of 4 weeks. Two samplers were collected weekly from each site to monitor the increase in target analytes over time. Extracts were analyzed using the CALUX bioassay and the total dioxin-like PCB toxicity was reported for the aqueous phase (water column), as well as the solid phase (sediment and sludge) in both sampling sites. The time-weighted average concentration (TWA) of dl-PCBs in wastewater of the paper mill during the sampling period ranged between 7.1 and 9.1 pg-BEQL(-1), while that of the drainage canal ranged between 9.5 and 12.2 pg-BEQL(-1). The dl-PCBs in the fibrous sludge (paper mill) and bottom sediment (drainage canal) were 0.5 and 0.4 pg-BEQg(-1) dry-weight, respectively. The organic-carbon normalized partition coefficients between sediment and water (logKoc) for the paper mill and the canal were 2.4 and 4.3, respectively.|5|2014|Talanta (Talanta)||Addeck, Croes, van Langenhove, Denison, Afify, Gao, Elskens, Baeyens.

Time-integrated monitoring of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) in urban and industrial wastewaters using a ceramic toximeter and the CALUX bioassay|Addeck, Amr; Croes, Kim; van Langenhove, Kersten; Denison, Michael S.; Elhamalawy, Ahmed; Elskens, Marc; Baeyens, Willy||The ceramic toximeter as a passive sampler in combination with the CALUX bioassay was utilized as a time-integrated pollution-assessment technique for dioxin-like PCDD/Fs in wastewaters. Toximeters filled with XCARB and enclosed in stainless steel cages were submerged in wastewater of Belbeis drainage-canal and EMAK paper-mill, located in Egypt, for 28 days. Two samplers were removed every week from each site. Extracts from toximeters, from bottom-sediments, and from paper-mill sludge were analyzed by the CALUX. Results showed a regular increase in the amounts of PCDD/Fs trapped by the toximeters as sampling time increased. Time-weighted average concentrations (TWA) of PCDD/Fs in the wastewaters of the drainage-canal and paper-mill were 231 (214-281) and 26 (24.1-32.6) pg-BEQL(-1), respectively. Compared to literature data, this means a high pollution level for the drainage-canal water, while the pollution level in the paper-mill wastewater is similar to that reported for other paper mills. The PCDD/Fs levels in the drainage-canal bottom-sediments and in the paper-mill sludge were 8.3 and 14.6 pg-BEQg(-1) dry-weight, at the lower end of internationally reported values in similar compartments. The sampling rate of the tested toximeters for dissolved PCDD/Fs was about 3.6 mL d(-1). Sediment/water partitioning coefficient logKd of PCDD/Fs in the drainage-canal and the paper-mill was 1.42 and 2.70 respectively. The organic-carbon normalized partition coefficient logKoc was 4.17 and 3.19 respectively, and is lower than the reported values for other sites.|5|2014|Chemosphere (Chemosphere)||Addeck, Croes, van Langenhove, Denison, Elhamalawy, Elskens, Baeyens.

To duckweeds (Landoltia punctata), nanoparticulate copper oxide is more inhibitory than the soluble copper in the bulk solution|Shi, Jiyan; Abid, Aamir D.; Kennedy, Ian M.; Hristova, Krassimira R.; Silk, Wendy K.|Angiosperms/drug effects/growth & development/metabolism; Chlorophyll/metabolism; Copper/metabolism/toxicity; Nanoparticles/toxicity; Water Pollutants, Chemical/metabolism/toxicity|CuO nanoparticles (CuO-NP) were synthesized in a hydrogen diffusion flame. Particle size and morphology were characterized using scanning mobility particle sizing, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. The solubility of CuO-NP varied with both pH and presence of other ions. CuO-NP and comparable doses of soluble Cu were applied to duckweeds, Landoltia punctata. Growth was inhibited 50% by either 0.6 mg L(-1) soluble copper or by 1.0 mg L(-1) CuO-NP that released only 0.16 mg L(-1) soluble Cu into growth medium. A significant decrease of chlorophyll was observed in plants stressed by 1.0 mg L(-1) CuO-NP, but not in the comparable 0.2 mg L(-1) soluble Cu treatment. The Cu content of fronds exposed to CuO-NP is four times higher than in fronds exposed to an equivalent dose of soluble copper, and this is enough to explain the inhibitory effects on growth and chlorophyll content.|7|2011|Environ.

Toward understanding amines and their degradation products from postcombustion CO2 capture processes with aerosol mass spectrometry|Ge, Xinlei; Shaw, Stephanie L.; Zhang, Qi||Amine-based postcombustion CO2 capture (PCCC) is a promising technique for reducing CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning plants. A concern of the technique, however, is the emission of amines and their degradation byproducts. To assess the environmental risk of this technique, standardized stack sampling and analytical methods are needed. Here we report on the development of an integrated approach that centers on the application of a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) for characterizing amines and PCCC-relevant species. Molecular characterization is achieved via ion chromatography (IC) and electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The method has been optimized, particularly, by decreasing the AMS vaporizer temperature, to gain quantitative information on the elemental composition and major nitrogen-containing species in laboratory-degraded amine solvents commonly tested for PCCC applications, including ethanolamine (MEA), methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), and piperazine (PIP). The AMS-derived nitrogen-to-carbon (N/C) ratios for the degraded solvent and product mixtures agree well with the results from a total organic carbon and total nitrogen (TOC/TN) analyzer. In addition, marker ions identified in the AMS spectra are used to estimate the mass contributions of individual species. Overall, our results indicate that this new approach is suitable for characterizing PCCC-related mixtures as well as organic nitrogen species in other sample types. As an online instrument, AMS can be used for both real-time characterization of emissions from operating PCCC plants and ambient particles in the vicinity of the facilities.|1|2014|Environ. Sci.

Toxicity and metabolism of methylnaphthalenes: comparison with naphthalene and 1-nitronaphthalene|Lin, Ching Yu; Wheelock, Asa M.; Morin, Dexter; Baldwin, R. Michael; Lee, Myong Gong; Taff, Aysha; Plopper, Charles; Buckpitt, Alan; Rohde, Arlean|Animals; Environmental Exposure/adverse effects; Humans; Lung Diseases/chemically induced/metabolism; Naphthalenes/metabolism/toxicity|Naphthalene and close structural analogues have been shown to cause necrosis of bronchiolar epithelial cells in mice by both inhalation exposure and by systemic administration. Cancer bioassays of naphthalene in mice have demonstrated a slight increase in bronchiolar/alveolar adenomas in female mice, and in inflammation and metaplasia of the olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity. Similar work in rats demonstrated a significant, and concentration-dependent increase in the incidence of respiratory epithelial adenomas and neuroblastomas in the nasal epithelium of both male and female rats. Although the studies on the acute toxicity of the methylnaphthalene derivatives are more limited, it appears that the species selective toxicity associated with naphthalene administration also is observed with methylnaphthalenes. Chronic administration of the methylnaphthalenes, however, failed to demonstrate the same oncogenic potential as that observed with naphthalene. The information available on the isopropylnaphthalene derivatives suggests that they are not cytotoxic. Like the methylnaphthalenes, 1-nitronaphthalene causes lesions in both Clara and ciliated cells. However, the species selective lung toxicity observed in the mouse with both naphthalene and the methylnaphthalenes is not seen with 1-nitronaphthalene. With 1-nitronaphthalene, the rat is far more susceptible to parenteral administration of the compound than mice. The wide-spread distribution of these compounds in the environment and the high potential for low level exposure to humans supports a need for further work on the mechanisms of toxicity in animal models with attention to whether these processes are applicable to humans. Although it is tempting to suppose that the toxicity and mechanisms of toxicity of the alkylnaphthalenes and nitronaphthalenes are similar to naphthalene, there is sufficient published literature to suggest that this may not be the case. Certainly the enzymes involved in the metabolic activation of each of these substrates are likely to differ. The available data showing extensive oxidation of the aromatic nucleus of naphthalene, nitronaphthalene and the methylnaphthalenes (with some oxidation of the methyl group) contrast with the isopropylnaphthalene derivatives, where the major metabolites involve side chain oxidation. Overall, these data support the view that ring epoxidation is a key step in the process involved in cytotoxicity. Whether the epoxide itself or a downstream metabolite mediates the toxic effects is still not clear even with naphthalene, the best studied of this group of compounds. Additional work is needed in several areas to further assess the potential human health consequences of exposure to these agents. These studies should involve the definition of the extent and severity of methylnaphthalene toxicity after single dose exposures with attention to both the nasal and respiratory epithelia. The cytochromes P450 responsible for the initial activation of these agents in rodents with subsequent complimentary studies in primate models should help determine whether key metabolic processes responsible for toxicity occur also in primates. Finally, the precise involvement of reactive metabolite formation and adduction of cellular proteins in toxicity will be important in not only assessing the potential for human toxicity, but also in developing an understanding of the genetic and environmental factors which could alter the toxicity of these agents.|4|2009|Toxicology (Toxicology)||Lin, Wheelock, Morin, Baldwin, Lee, Taff, Plopper, Buckpitt, Rohde.

Toxicology in the fast lane: application of high-throughput bioassays to detect modulation of key enzymes and receptors|Morisseau, Christophe; Merzlikin, Oleg; Lin, Amy; He, Guochun; Feng, Wei; Padilla, Isela; Denison, Michael S.; Pessah, Isaac N.; Hammock, Bruce D.|Animals; Carboxylesterase/antagonists & inhibitors; High-Throughput Screening Assays/methods; Humans; Naphthoquinones/pharmacology; Receptors, Androgen/drug effects; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/drug effects; Receptors, Estrogen/drug effects; Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel/drug effects; Toxicology/methods; Triclosan/toxicity|BACKGROUND: Legislation at state, federal, and international levels is requiring rapid evaluation of the toxicity of numerous chemicals. Whole-animal toxicologic studies cannot yield the necessary throughput in a cost-effective fashion, leading to a critical need for a faster and more cost-effective toxicologic evaluation of xenobiotics. OBJECTIVES: We tested whether mechanistically based screening assays can rapidly provide information on the potential for compounds to affect key enzymes and receptor targets, thus identifying those compounds requiring further in-depth analysis. METHODS: A library of 176 synthetic chemicals was prepared and examined in a high-throughput screening (HTS) manner using nine enzyme-based and five receptor-based bioassays. RESULTS: All the assays have high Z' values, indicating good discrimination among compounds in a reliable fashion, and thus are suitable for HTS assays. On average, three positive hits were obtained per assay. Although we identified compounds that were previously shown to inhibit a particular enzyme class or receptor, we surprisingly discovered that triclosan, a microbiocide present in personal care products, inhibits carboxylesterases and that dichlone, a fungicide, strongly inhibits the ryanodine receptors. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the need to rapidly screen tens of thousands of anthropogenic compounds, our study shows the feasibility of using combined HTS assays as a novel approach toward obtaining toxicologic data on numerous biological end points. The HTS assay approach is very useful to quickly identify potentially hazardous compounds and to prioritize them for further in-depth studies.|5|2009|Environ. Health Perspect.

Treatment of mice with 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin markedly increases the levels of a number of cytochrome P450 metabolites of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the liver and lung|Yang, Jun; Solaimani, Parrisa; Dong, Hua; Hammock, Bruce; Hankinson, Oliver||We previously reported that 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) increased the levels of several cytochrome P450 metabolites of the omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), arachidonic acid (ARA) and linoleic acid in the serum, liver, lung and spleen of C57BL/6 mice in an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-dependent fashion. These increases correlated with increased levels of CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and/or CYP1B1. In the current study, we measured 77 oxylipins, including 59 that we had not measured previously, and demonstrate that TCDD also markedly increases the levels of many epoxide and diol metabolites of the omega-3 PUFAs, α-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docasahexaenoic acid (DHA) in these mice. Since these epoxide metabolites have been reported to have opposite effects on angiogenesis, tumor growth and tumor metastasis compared with the equivalent metabolites of omega-6 PUFA, these observations have important implications with regard to the potential involvement of the cytochrome P450 metabolites of PUFAs in mediating the biological effects of TCDD and other agonists of AHR.|Core A|2013|J Toxicol Sci (The Journal of toxicological sciences)||Yang, Solaimani, Dong, Hammock, Hankinson.

While TCC has been linked to a range of health and environmental effects, few studies have been conducted linking exposure to TCC and induction of xenobiotic metabolism through regulation by environmental sensors such as the nuclear xenobiotic receptors (XenoRs). To identify the ability of TCC to activate xenobiotic sensors, we monitored XenoR activities in response to TCC treatment using luciferase-based reporter assays. Among the XenoRs in the reporter screening assay, TCC promotes both constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) activities. TCC treatment to hUGT1 mice resulted in induction of the UGT1A genes in liver. This induction was dependent upon the constitutive active/androstane receptor (CAR) because no induction occurred in hUGT1Car(-/-) mice. Induction of the UGT1A genes by TCC corresponded with induction of Cyp2b10, another CAR target gene. TCC was demonstrated to be a phenobarbital-like activator of CAR in receptor-based assays. While it has been suggested that TCC be classified as an endocrine disruptor, it activates ERα leading to induction of Cyp1b1 in female ovaries as well as in promoter activity. Activation of ERα by TCC in receptor-based assays also promotes induction of human CYP2B6. These observations demonstrate that TCC activates nuclear xenobiotic receptors CAR and ERα both in vivo and in vitro and might have the potential to alter normal physiological homeostasis.

Triclosan impairs swimming behavior and alters expression of excitation-contraction coupling proteins in fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas)|Fritsch, Erika B.; Connon, Richard E.; Werner, Inge; Davies, Rebecca E.; Beggel, Sebastian; Feng, Wei; Pessah, Isaac N.||Triclosan (TCS), a high volume chemical widely used in consumer products, is a known aquatic contaminant found in fish inhabiting polluted watersheds. Mammalian studies have recently demonstrated that TCS disrupts signaling between the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), two proteins essential for excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in striated muscle. We investigated the swimming behavior and expression of EC coupling proteins in larval fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed to TCS for up to 7 days. Concentrations as low as 75 mug L(-1) significantly altered fish swimming activity after 1 day; which was consistent after 7 days of exposure. The mRNA transcription and protein levels of RyR and DHPR (subunit CaV1.1) isoforms changed in a dose and time dependent manner. Crude muscle homogenates from exposed larvae did not display any apparent changes in receptor affinity toward known radioligands. In nonexposed crude muscle homogenates, TCS decreased the binding of [(3)H]PN20-110 to the DHPR and decreased the binding of [(3)H]-ryanodine to the RyR, demonstrating a direct impact at the receptor level. These results support TCS's impact on muscle function in vertebrates further exemplifying the need to re-evaluate the risks this pollutant poses to aquatic environments.|5|2013|Environ Sci Technol (Environmental science & technology)||Fritsch, Connon, Werner, Davies, Beggel, Feng, Pessah.

We have studied the quenching of the 392-nm peak (attributed to XIIa bound inside the active center of the enzyme) of the mixture EH +XIIa by various strong transparent inhibitors (competing with XIIa for binding to EH), and measured the corresponding values of the Stern-Volmer constants, K(mix)(SV). Strong EH inhibitors demonstrate different replacement behavior which can be used to distinguish them. We further demonstrate a novel fluorescent assay which allows to distinguish highly potent inhibitors and to visualize the strongest among them.

Unique mechanistic insights into the beneficial effects of soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors in the prevention of cardiac fibrosis|Sirish, Padmini; Li, Ning; Liu, Jun-Yan; Lee, Kin Sing Stephen; Hwang, Sung Hee; Qiu, Hong; Zhao, Cuifen; Ma, Siu Mei; López, Javier E.; Hammock, Bruce D.; Chiamvimonvat, Nipavan||Tissue fibrosis represents one of the largest groups of diseases for which there are very few effective therapies. In the heart, myocardial infarction (MI) resulting in the loss of cardiac myocytes can culminate in adverse cardiac remodeling leading to eventual heart failure. Adverse cardiac remodeling includes myocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and electrical remodeling. We have previously demonstrated the beneficial effects of several potent soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors (sEHIs) in different models of cardiac hypertrophy and failure. Here, we directly determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of sEHIs in cardiac remodeling post-MI. Treatment with a potent sEHI, 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidine-4-yl)urea (TPPU), which was started 1 wk post-MI in a murine model, results in a significant improvement in cardiac function. Importantly, treatment with TPPU results in a decrease in cardiac fibrosis as quantified using histological and immunostaining techniques. Moreover, single-cell-based assays demonstrate that treatment with TPPU results in a significant decrease not only in the percentages but also the proliferative capacity of different populations of cardiac fibroblasts as well as a reduction in the migration of fibroblasts into the heart from the bone marrow. Our study provides evidence for a possible unique therapeutic strategy to reduce cardiac fibrosis and improve cardiac function post-MI.|Core A|2013|Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.

Upconversion in NaYF(4):Yb, Er nanoparticles amplified by metal nanostructures|Deng, Wei; Sudheendra, L.; Zhao, Jiangbo; Fu, Junxiang; Jin, Dayong; Kennedy, Ian M.; Goldys, Ewa M.||Upconversion (UC) fluorescence in NaYF(4):Yb, Er nanoparticles amplified by metal nanostructures was compared in two nanostructure geometries: gold nanoshells surrounding nanoparticles and silver nanostructures adjacent to the nanoparticles, both placed on a dielectric silica surface. Enhanced UC luminescence signals and modified lifetimes induced by these two metals were observed in our study. The UC luminescence intensities of green and red emissions were enhanced by Ag nanostructures by a factor of approximately 4.4 and 3.5, respectively. The corresponding UC lifetimes were reduced ∼ 1.7-fold and ∼ 2.4-fold. In NaYF(4):Yb, Er nanoparticles encapsulated in gold nanoshells, higher luminescence enhancement factors were obtained (∼9.1-fold for the green emission and ∼ 6.7-fold for the red emission). However, the Au shell coating extended the red emission by a factor of 1.5 and did not obviously change the lifetime of green emission. The responsible mechanisms such as plasmonic enhancement and surface effects are discussed.|2|2011|Nanotechnology (Nanotechnology)||Deng, Sudheendra, Zhao, Fu, Jin, Kennedy, Goldys. (2011).

Use of a soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor as an adjunctive analgesic in a horse with laminitis|Guedes, Alonso Gp; Morisseau, Christophe; Sole, Albert; Soares, Joao Hn; Ulu, Arzu; Dong, Hua; Hammock, Bruce D.||HISTORY: A 4-year old, 500 kg Thoroughbred female horse diagnosed with bilateral forelimb laminitis and cellulitis on the left forelimb became severely painful and refractory to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy (flunixin meglumine on days 1, 2, 3 and 4; and phenylbutazone on days 5, 6 and 7) alone or in combination with gabapentin (days 6 and 7). PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Pain scores assessed independently by three individuals with a visual analog scale (VAS; 0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain) were 8.5 on day 6, and it increased to 9.5 on day 7. Non-invasive blood pressure monitoring revealed severe hypertension. MANAGEMENT: As euthanasia was being considered for humane reasons, a decision was made to add an experimental new drug, trans-4-{4-[3-(4-Trifluoromethoxy-phenyl)-ureido]-cyclohexyloxy}-benzoic acid (t-TUCB), which is a soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitor, to the treatment protocol. Dose and frequency of administration were selected based on the drug potency against equine sEH to produce plasma concentrations within the range of 30 nmol L(-1) and 2.5 μmol L(-1) . Pain scores decreased sharply and remarkably following t-TUCB administration and blood pressure progressively decreased to physiologic normal values. Plasma concentrations of t-TUCB, measured daily, were within the expected range, whereas phenylbutazone and gabapentin plasma levels were below the suggested efficacious concentrations. FOLLOW UP: No adverse effects were detected on clinical and laboratory examinations during and after t-TUCB administration. No new episodes of laminitis have been noted up to the time of writing (120 days following treatment). CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of sEH with t-TUCB was associated with a significant improvement in pain scores in one horse with laminitis whose pain was refractory to the standard of care therapy. No adverse effects were noticed.

Use of a soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor in smoke-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|Wang, Lei; Yang, Jun; Guo, Lei; Uyeminami, Dale; Dong, Hua; Hammock, Bruce D.; Pinkerton, Kent E.|Animals; Benzoates/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Body Weight/drug effects; Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid; Cytokines/biosynthesis; Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Epoxide Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors; Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/drug therapy/enzymology/etiology; Rats; Rolipram/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Smoke/adverse effects; Tobacco|Tobacco smoke-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a prolonged inflammatory condition of the lungs characterized by progressive and largely irreversible airflow limitation attributable to a number of pathologic mechanisms, including bronchitis, bronchiolitis, emphysema, mucus plugging, pulmonary hypertension, and small-airway obstruction. Soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors (sEHIs) demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties in a rat model after acute exposure to tobacco smoke. We compared the efficacy of sEHI t-TUCB (trans-4-{4-[3-(4-trifluoromethoxy-phenyl)-ureido]-cyclohexyloxy}-benzoic acid) and the phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor Rolipram (Biomol International, Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) to reduce lung injury and inflammation after subacute exposure to tobacco smoke over a period of 4 weeks. Pulmonary physiology, bronchoalveolar lavage, cytokine production, and histopathology were analyzed to determine the efficacy of sEHI and Rolipram to ameliorate tobacco smoke-induced inflammation and injury in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. Both t-TUCB and Rolipram inhibited neutrophil elevation in bronchoalveolar lavage. sEHI t-TUCB suppressed IFN-γ, while improving lung function by reducing tobacco smoke-induced total respiratory resistance and tissue damping (small-airway and peripheral tissue resistance). Increases in tobacco smoke-induced alveolar airspace size were attenuated by t-TUCB. Rolipram inhibited the production of airway mucus. Both t-TUCB and Rolipram inhibited vascular remodeling-related growth factor. These findings suggest that sEHI t-TUCB has therapeutic potential for treating COPD by improving lung function and attenuating the lung inflammation and emphysematous changes caused by tobacco smoke. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that sEHI exerts significant protective effects after repeated, subacute tobacco smoke-induced lung injury in a rat model of COPD.|Core A|2012|Am.

Using groundwater age distributions to estimate the effective parameters of Fickian and non-Fickian models of solute transport|Engdahl, N. B.; Ginn, T. R.; Fogg, G. E.|groundwater age; solute transport; parameter estimation; nonstationary; stochastic-convective transport; mass-transfer; porous-media; heterogeneous media; exposure-time; simulation; dispersion; behavior; systems; flow|Groundwater age distributions are used to estimate the parameters of Fickian, and non-Fickian, effective models of solute transport. Based on the similarities between the transport and age equations, we develop a deconvolution based approach that describes transport between two monitoring wells. We show that the proposed method gives exact estimates of the travel time distribution between two wells when the domain is stationary and that the method still provides useful information on transport when the domain is non-stationary. The method is demonstrated using idealized uniform and layered 2-D aquifers. Homogeneous transport is determined exactly and non-Fickian transport in a layered aquifer was also approximated very well, even though this example problem is shown to be scale-dependent. This work introduces a method that addresses a significant limitation of tracer tests and non-Fickian transport modeling which is the difficulty in determining the effective parameters of the transport model.

Vitamin D enhances corneal epithelial barrier function|Yin, Zhaohong; Pintea, Victorina; Lin, Yanping; Hammock, Bruce D.; Watsky, Mitchell A.|25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-Hydroxylase/genetics; Animals; Aqueous Humor/metabolism; Blotting, Western; Calcifediol/pharmacology; Calcitriol/pharmacology; Cell Line; Electric Impedance; Epithelium, Corneal/metabolism; Humans; Inulin/metabolism; Mass Spectrometry; Membrane Proteins/metabolism; Mice; Occludin; Permeability/drug effects; RNA, Messenger/metabolism; Rabbits; Receptors, Calcitriol/genetics; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Vitreous Body/metabolism|PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) (25(OH)D(3)) and/or its active metabolite, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)), can enhance corneal epithelial barrier function. The authors also determined if corneas contain mRNA for the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and 1α-hydroxylase, the enzyme required to convert 25(OH)D(3) to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), and measured vitamin D metabolite concentrations in aqueous and vitreous humor. METHODS: RT-PCR was used to examine mouse, rabbit, and human corneal epithelial VDR and 1α-hydroxylase mRNA. Vitamin D metabolites were measured using a selective vitamin D derivatizing agent and mass spectroscopy. Barrier function experiments were performed by measuring inulin permeability (IP) and/or transepithelial resistance (TER) in control, 25(OH)D(3)-, and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-treated human and rabbit corneal epithelial monolayers cultured on permeable inserts. Ca(2+) was removed, then reintroduced to the culture medium while IP and TER readings were taken. Occludin levels were examined using Western blotting. RESULTS: All corneal samples were positive for both VDR and 1α-hydroxylase mRNA. All vitamin D metabolites except for unhydroxylated vitamin D(3) were detected in aqueous and vitreous humor. Epithelial cells showed increased TER, decreased IP, and increased occludin levels when cultured with 25(OH)D(3) and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that corneas contain mRNA for VDR and 1α-hydroxylase as well as significant vitamin D concentrations. 25(OH)D(3) and its active metabolite 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), both enhance corneal epithelial barrier function.|Core A|2011|Invest.

Vitamin D intake needed to maintain target serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in participants with low sun exposure and dark skin pigmentation is substantially higher than current recommendations|Hall, Laura M.; Kimlin, Michael G.; Aronov, Pavel A.; Hammock, Bruce D.; Slusser, James R.; Woodhouse, Leslie R.; Stephensen, Charles B.|Adult; African Americans; California; Diet Records; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Humans; Male; Nutritional Requirements; Seasons; Skin Pigmentation/physiology; Sunlight; Vitamin D/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacology; Young Adult|Cutaneous cholecalciferol synthesis has not been considered in making recommendations for vitamin D intake. Our objective was to model the effects of sun exposure, vitamin D intake, and skin reflectance (pigmentation) on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) in young adults with a wide range of skin reflectance and sun exposure. Four cohorts of participants (n = 72 total) were studied for 7-8 wk in the fall, winter, spring, and summer in Davis, CA [38.5 degrees N, 121.7 degrees W, Elev. 49 ft (15 m)]. Skin reflectance was measured using a spectrophotometer, vitamin D intake using food records, and sun exposure using polysulfone dosimeter badges. A multiple regression model (R(2) = 0.55; P < 0.0001) was developed and used to predict the serum 25(OH)D concentration for participants with low [median for African ancestry (AA)] and high [median for European ancestry (EA)] skin reflectance and with low [20th percentile, approximately 20 min/d, approximately 18% body surface area (BSA) exposed] and high (80th percentile, approximately 90 min/d, approximately 35% BSA exposed) sun exposure, assuming an intake of 200 iu/d (5 ug/d). Predicted serum 25(OH)D concentrations for AA individuals with low and high sun exposure in the winter were 24 and 42 nmol/L and in the summer were 40 and 60 nmol/L. Corresponding values for EA individuals were 35 and 60 nmol/L in the winter and in the summer were 58 and 85 nmol/L. To achieve 25(OH)D > or =75 nmol/L, we estimate that EA individuals with high sun exposure need 1300 iu/d vitamin D intake in the winter and AA individuals with low sun exposure need 2100-3100 iu/d year-round.|Core A|2010|J.
